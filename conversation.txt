"also, look at this"
"Yea exactly"
"Which would probably be very expensive and a Charleston judge would probably throw it out"
"whic hwould be more than its worth"
"I don't do either, so he'd have to try to sue me in Charleston"
"Because you can't really sue someone who doesn't live in or operate business out of your state"
"As long as whoever is trying to sue me lives out of state lol"
lol
"it...kind od is better not to have it.."
lol
"wow that's not often that this happens"
"Sort of funny how not having insurance actually protects me in this case lol"
"But I didn't have insurance for this particular show so now it would be really difficult for him to sue"
"Originally he was just like 'dont worry I'm just going to sue your insurance' which I think was his original idea because he probably could have easily done that"
haha
"yeah it seems that way"
"So anyway, I don't think he'll do anything but if he somehow manages to get a judge to hear his case, I have a lot of evidence basically saying he's an idiot"
lol
yeah
"because it wasn't yours"
"Because I had no animals for sale"
"DNR didn't even speak to me when they came in lol"
"No there's no way, it's up to him to know local laws because he's the one selling the snakes"
"you wouldn't need to be that detailed right"
lol
"it's not real"
"that's sort of true because if he wants to argue you didn't say NO CORN SNAKES!!!!!! but that's not a legal case"
"even though i did specifically tell him no native animals, and i have proof of him reading it"
"claiming its my fault because i didnt specifically tell him no corn snakes"
"yea but hes either stupid and doesnt know that or is just trying to intimidate me to ""Settle out of court"" with him"
wow
"sue you"
lol
"why would he even think to"
"that's lame"
"that's not a case, unless he has millions of dollars he won't be able to do anything with that"
"but this dude was supposed to be my friend lol"
"i dont think he actually will because hes in ohio and im in WV, and its very hard to sue someone from out of state"
"and he claims he is going to sue me to compensate him for this"
"goes back to ohio, and WV is now trying to make him pay like 400+ dollars for the fine, and he has to come to charleston to fight it"
"he gets ticketed"
anyway
"and i didnt know he had corn snakes so i didnt say anything to him"
"hes an idiot and didnt check native animals of WV"
"why then"
wait
"one of them was a guy ive done a lot of business with, spent upwards of 1500 dollars with him, sold animals for him, managed his FB page"
Wow
"dnr came into my show and ticketed two vendors for selling corn snakes, which are native and therefor illegal to sell"
"long story short"

like
"how was it not a little up to him"

"that's so annoying though"
"right exactly.  my dad said if it were up to him she would have gone to jail lmao"

"Hi there,

My name is Hunter Armstead, and I am a psychology student at WVSU.  My friend Michael has alerted me to a situation between him and his ex-roomate, Isaac.  I asked if there was any way I could help him, and he gave your email address to me and said you would be the best person to talk to.

A little bit of background on my relationship with Michael; he and I have been best friends since the age of 4 years old.  I have known his family as long as my memory serves me, and I have lived in his house during a semester he was away at OSU.  I'm sure you can tell yourself, but Michael is a kind, intelligent, gentle soul just trying to get through his college years and find something he is passionate about to start a career.  He does not get pleasure out the current situation he is in regarding his ex-roomate, and really seems quite distraught that his friends at OSU are now turning against him.  

I would also like to add my own opinion on the matter, and that is that Isaac has been incredibly tortuorous and malevolent to Michael for most of the time they've lived together, and I have been telling Michael to get a restraining order or call the police for probably over a year now.  The things he has told me Isaac has done, I absolutely would have called the police, but Michael didn't want to start an upset and was afraid of what Isaac may do.  Now that he has gotten away from Isaac, it appears his fears were correct; Isaac is trying to take his only friends away from home and drive him to madness while he tries to focus on school.  Michael probably has the messages containing my pleading for him to contact the police, because I feared for his safety.

I will only speak about Isaac on the level of facts, as in what I have personally witnessed.  I spent Thanksgiving with Michael and Isaac last year and volunteered to make them Thanksgiving dinner, as neither of them are great at cooking and I wanted Michael to have some home cooked food.

The little amount I have seen of the third room mate, Lea, I can only say was...strange.  I don't know much about her other than she seems a bit unstable from my few interactions with her.

Isaac was genial around me during the visit, but I often caught him picking at Michael and trying ti start small arguments.  He went so far as to invite his ex-boyfriend to stay with them, even though Isaac had just broken up with Michael, and Michael was incredibly emotionally shaken by this.  The entire weekend was very awkward for me, and Isaac seemed to be ""plastic"", seeming charismatic and kind one moment and narcissistic and cruel the next.

Michael's family has been incredibly concerned about him, and his mother and stepfather both work in the mental health industry.  They worried often that if Michael did not get away from Isaac, that something very bad would happen.  I believe Michael ended up in the hospital several times from the grief Isaac caused him, but I'm sure he could tell you more about that than I can.

I know it is probably odd getting an email about this situation from someone you don't know, especially as I'm sure you're a very busy person.  I would just like you to observe any evidence Michael has showing that Isaac has done some truly repugnant things to him.  I haven't seen the evidence myself as, honestly, I don't think I could stomach it.  

Thank you for your time,

-Hunter"
"I will find those messages"

But I'm really insanely jealous; it's a unique and likely a heavenly blessing to be able to postpone dealing with how fundamentally you fucked up huge parts of me and my life and just leave it out of your mind while I remain neck-deep in mud gasping for air, and since the malice through your blood is already on a pleasantly distracting journey to do it all over again, why feel the urgency to look back and address things with me, right? I'm stuck, I can be left, like you begged me not to do to you the entire time we've known each other. Am I really so stupid that I actually stayed this long for you? Well no, you threatened to kill yourself, what was I supposed to do. 

Well at least this new one's in a really good and stable emotional place in his life so he could handle the toxic infection once it takes him over, right? Or if he can't, will you just leave your damage behind and find a new one again to see how much it takes for them to break? Why grow up and face your faults if you can just postpone it, ignore it, silence your victims, and convince yourself you live in a reality where it's not abhorrent to look at yourself in a mirror? I mean some feel a responsibility to others, basic human decency usually does it for the rest, but I've come to learn what to expect as a head above the earth you just stepped over in your path miles back. I'm glad your shoes got a little less muddy. 

I do remember when you were nice to me - we were laughing, trying to silently communicate to see if we should hold hands, calling each other cute even though it was kinda awkward within ourselves, but worth it for a bashful smile that seemed to emerge from deep within the other person - I wonder how long it will take for you to tear him down and destroy his sense of self too. Maybe it's a pretty reliable timeline, especially since you admittedly aren't aware of most of what you did, or at least aren't willing to accept it - not even sure which is more pathetic, or which is more dangerous. Perhaps think of others when considering whether or not you want to go through the actions that have devastated people, not just for you or the ones you've hurt, but the one's you'll be taking down the same road. If you want to own up to your actions and face the reality of this situation, which if I'm being serious I think at least part of that I'm partially owed, it's not going to be with a bouquet of roses and kind voices, because that is the last thing you deserve. I suggest you do everything you can to change that."

"45 minute reptile phone call"

"But it doesn't always permeate"
"Like I can try"
"There's no point in reasoning with him"
"He becomes so emotional"
"Any time we have had a fight"
"Uggh well to be honest"
"He's trying to say basically like, I'm trying so don't be sad and make me feel bad"
"have you ever brought this up?"
"Yea basically"
"but he's making it all about how he feels when you're expressing how you feel in that moment"
"it's him saying he cares"
"so it's not him being mad about what you said like overall"
"i see"
"Like ""I'm trying so hard to do whatever you want me to because I love you"""
"Or like... lowkey defensive"
"I mean yes I'd say 50/50 chance he would get defensive"
"I'm  thinking it's a way you phrasse things problem or think about him, it's just him overreacting"
"he would take the general theme of that as accusatory?"
"But it gets hard sometimes and I like to use a quick fix when I can, like lunch with my bf"
"Which I know is wrong because I'm in charge of my emotions"
"""you know that I've been really stressed and depressed recently and I just wanted you to go to lunch with me because you help me feel better but your car is more important to you than how I feel"""
Basically
"had you spoken"
"what would you have said"
"in a sentence like"
or
"ok so what did you want to convey"
"And make it worse"
"It would come out as accusatory"
"Because I knew if I told him why"
"And left"
"And I just said ""I don't feel good"""
"at least you are precise"
"Yea he was asking me what was wrong when I was leaving and crying"
"but like there's a flip side"
hahaha
"Yes i know"
"you both have to find a away to quit it"
"If I practice my words it's normally so that my attacks sting the hardest hahaha"
however
"and it's like idk how i'm gonna end up reacting"
"i have a similar issue personally"
haha
"So i'd practice what you'r ewere gonna say. I'm incredibly volatile so i often practice and refine my wrods in situations like this to avoid a blow up so i'm in better control"
"We are both emotionally stubborn lol"
"Yea because he gets really emotionally defensive too"
hm
"i see"
oh
"is your fear you being mean and his rxn or his meanness and"
"Resulting in a big mess"
"So if I accidentally attack him he will get upset and accidentally attack me"
"And he does the same thing I think"
"And I don't even realize my tone and the words I'm using"
"yeah same lol"
"I can get pretty mean when I'm upset"
"I get that but my fear is"
"no you don't wan to make him upset and make things worse. But life and relationships are sometimes a pain with emotional stuff but they are worth it. You are not validating your own emotions here. You need to get this stuff out in the open, have a small bit of upset with him, or risk resenting him for something that might seem small later down the line"
"i recently learned this"
well
"Positive thinking I guess"
"But I don't always know what to do about the ways I feel"
"And I don't want that to happen because then it's a bigger problem"
"He could also get upset and depressed"
"And if he gets caught up in my bad days"
"I know he is an emotional person"
"i can see that yeah you do"
"And he doesn't really directly help"
"I have SO MUCH on my shoulders"
"I just get frustrated"
"It's been ""almost done"" for two weeks"
"Yea and he keeps telling me it's almost done"
"yeah that's good but then there's a point to where it's like how do you fit in to what's happenign lol"
"ahhhh i see"
"But he focuses so hard on it that I get left out"
"Which I can appreciate"
"I mean I think he knows how I feel about the car thing, but he says he's trying to get it running so if my car dies I'll still have a vehicle"
"sometimes you have to talk about this though ya know"
"And understand where he's coming from"
"Not think about it"
"I try to like"
"is he just not seeing this as an issue?"
"i mean"
"what the hell?"
dude
"I have no one at all to talk to this about"
"Won't go to lunch with me or do anything with me because of this car"
"He's busy working on his car, which he's been doing for over a month"
"He hasn't said anything to me"
"I just left his house crying"
"Doesn't make sense to me"
"And I work two jobs and he doesn't work"
"We are trying to get a house"
"So it's like if he worked a job I could relax a little more"
"Not unless I have to"
"But I don't really use his money"
"Well he gets 1200-1600 a month"
"But the point is that he doesn't need to? And you do? Or"
"But it hasn't happened yet"
"He's ""trying"" to get a job with a VA office that'll probably be minimum wage"
"And takes less hours than me"
"Also I have secret resentment that James doesn't work"

I udnerstand it, but I'm bitter about the cat, I'm very sad because our relationship is very solid and I will miss him, and due to the lateness in thesemester it's gonna be hard to find a place.

"âLove something in a bookâ seems to communicate that it is easy and beneficial to be interested in furthering our own understanding of the natural world through reading, more specifically research and observation.

"the real thing is like"
"sounds like he's contracted to work for him"
"exactly haha i just thought that was crazy"
"Honestly idk the full story but George Damous is his like boss haha"
"Yes and no. Johns practice is his own but I think he like"
"and john works for them right?"
"right, and i just figured out that damous only has a masters in psychology lol"
"but it's a valid science because it uses the same tools just to study behavior and not chemicals"
lol
"it does not"
"Yea that's true, but a lot of society doesn't see it that way.  not that it matters what society thinks though"
"i mean, well, the entire field operates using the scientific method. Psychology is empirical haha. it's not similar to chemistry but like, i'd say practicing as a psycholgist is like an art but the field itself is pretty science just a different breed"
"It's a degree of art"
"But it's not a degree of science"
"a psychologist is a scientist lol"
"i profiled myself"
"i always thought i had to be a scientist"
"everyone ive told is like ""yea that makes more sense"" haha"
"in high shcool at least"
"i always thought you would study psychology"
"luckily online classes = no crazy psych profs"
"hes a dick lol.  but a different prof finally advised me"
ok
ohhhhhhh
"that's really odd"
"probably on his way out, according to my advisor"

"he doesnt answer emails"

"exactly.  james will be done before me but i think state has a polisci masters program, weirdly enough"
"but you will also have an excuse to try a new place out ig haha"
"yeah unfortunately"

"i want to graduate asap so i can move lol"
"i bet you will"
yeah
"i think i'm going for 12 next semester"

"i'm down to 9 lol"
"but im taking 16 next semester"
"dropped math and chem lecture"
"so im officialy down to 8 credits this semester lol"
"definitely maybe ahaha"
"Bahaha. Sounds like he might be a doucher. But maybe not"
"hes too closed off to be i think. I talk to him for days sometimes, and then not for weeks. He saw me on campus and I haven't seen him in a while...he's just sends me a snapchat of me that says ""spotted"" and then nothing lol"
"As long as he isn't psychologically damaging"
"But you're not dating for marriage probably so what's the risk lol"
"Oh yes fun for sure"
"it could also be fun"
"Not as much experience"
"i suppose so lol"
"Younger is always work"
"Big time"
"Yea lol James took on a project with me"
"you're right"
true
"I mean, you never know. He could be mature. or he could not be."
"but i would be taking on a project"
"he's very compatible with me"
yeah
"Oh no. A young one."
"thats like"
"so eh do i wanna commit to that sort of thing"
"one huge issue though. he is a freshman."
"he also has red hair and piercings and is very cute"
"Maybe look into that"
"Oh that sounds promising"
"i just on top of all of that i fear he isn't intelligent...however theres this other guy ive been talking to a bit who is very cute, and in computer science and into discussing like nature and philosophy and things, and is sort of emotionally where i am, so i may explore that"
"i mean you're right"
"but yeah"
"oh man haha"
"Yea that's quite possible.  May take some time to understand him though.  You may not realize it but sometimes we are cynics.  but then again there is Josh and how gross he is lol"
"that's probably it."
"but was like crawling all over me and kissing me continually. I think i'm older and he's a bit fascinated with me."
"i am fine with cuddles in bed"
"Head kisses are weird sometimes if you don't want them lol"
lol
"But he will do a voice of a black person"
"and wouldnt stop"
"he just kept doing things that freaked me out"
"Like Jame's loves basically everyone. He's very compassionate"
"its not that i think hes racist"
trusies
"It's another thing to wish harm upon people of a different race"
"i felt awkward lol"
"i jsut became uncomfortable"
"It's one thing to do a voice for comedic effect"
"idc what his opinions are"
"this wasn't one weird thing"
"he did a black guy voice and a ""much gayer guy voice"""
"oh no I don't want an sjw"
"At least. that's what I've found"
"You can't look for an sjw in a relationship. You will not be happy lol"
"You have to understand though"
VOICE
"not even accent"
"RIGHT WTF IS THAT EVEN"
"he's very autist"
"An Indian voice"
Hahahahaha
ahahahaha
"Ahhh okay. We'll that may be an issue with your intimacy. Or maybe not, he might just be too much lol"
"there have been a couple of instances of this."
"Also I'm afraid he's racist. He said that he could do a really good """"""""indian"""""""""""" voice and i asked him please dont do that."
"He's honestly fine, he just wants to be affectionate more than I would like."
"Is he just weird?"
"i appreciated it because i haven't had someone treat me that way in a long time. So I slept with him. THEN I LEARNED HE WAS A FREAK"
"I bought him drinks and he held my hand in public and said that he was enjoying hanging out and was being very nice"
"but also no haha"
Yes
"I mean like..."
"well, I had slept with him before and I watched him make a sexist comment to a female friend of mine who is an engineer, about her not understanding math...I was curious as to whether or not I could call him on that and maybe get to know him. It was successful"
"Because welcome to my whole life in Virginia Beach Hahaha"
"Did you sleep with him for a place to stay?"
"What's he look like"
"OMG hahahaha"
"and the real kicker is when he showed me his dildo collection, and i didn't utter a single word."
hahahahaha
"he kept like fucking, kissing my head, and i was like please, please stop"
"he kept cuddling up to me, and i would move, and he would pursue me."
"i do not like him."
"it was this 20 year old kid i hooked up with and like stayed in his dorm"
"That's hilarious"
"OMG Hahaha"
"And yes, it really was that lame."
"it was like a graph of a normal distribution, and they had bells around their neck. A bell curve."
"I saw someone with the following costume:"
"that's great"
HAAHA
"He freaked out when I put the make up on"
"Oh did you lol"

"i think """"""""liked"""""""""""" that photo"
"Isn't he adorable"
"We were vampires"
""
"Hey look at this"
"I'm glad to hear that. Hopefully they keep it up"
"it's in a very nice area though"
"it's not a big house"
"it's definitely no mansion"
"Because if so I know that house lol"
"Is it like a mansion with a cobblestone driveway?"
"it's pretty"
"It's really awesome. It's in the edgewood area, but like at the top of the hill right on the edge of some wooded area"

"How isn't here new place BTW?"
"Hahaha your mother"
"my mother sends me two emails with MMS attachments today...not a text with photos....emails TO me from her PHONE NUMBER. They are candid shots of an old guy working at a mall kiosk who looks like bernie sanders. She provided commentary on each of them."

"John just prescribed me vyvanse"
"We'll that's good."
"the pets make him feel better"

"Something he can manage"
"I actually was figuring that lol"
"it's actually pretty convenient"
"and he cares for them with OCD like precision"
yes
"Are the geckos still around?"
"Maybe let John treat him but be done with him. Get him help and continue taking care of yourself."
"but isaac is destroying his rapport with me."
"John wants to treat him and he's comign with my mom this weekend to speak with isaac one on one"
"That really is unfortunate for him.  I wish he could get good help.  He needs to be seeing some several times a week"
"psychotic depression, paranoia, intense anxiety and crippling CRIPPLING ocd and delusions"
"so am i, but i'm getting help and doing well"
"What is his issue mentally?"
"but that's the case"
"no excuse"
"he's very sick"
"It sounds like he's a dead weight"
"the thing now is like...I have distanced myself but he's still a part of my life. I have found myself again, and regained my confidence, so he's not affecting me like he used to. However, i'm annoyed."
"pretty much"
"Domino effect"
"Yea, when you put yourself in bad situations they wear on you and make you unstable and then you make me unstable lol"
"but now i'm quite aware"
"thats why we dont talk about this mucj"
"i know"
yeah
"not making one claim or another  aobut his character"
"Yea, quite a bit. To the point that I coukdnt help you with anything"
"he's been holding me back for a long time hasn't he"
"He needs help"
"Let them throw him out. he needs to go home."
"my mom and john want to buy out his lease and throw him out lol"
"Where is Lea?"
"working on that"
"Would you be able to move out or find a new roommate?"
"and get called a narccisst because isaac is a cynic"
"I'm really glad to hear so much positive stuff :)"
"act confident"
"say im confident"
"i finally reclaimed myself"
"but the issue is"
"but i'm ok lol"
"I'm just QUITE annoyed."
"pretty confident. I've been doing well. I'm still not totally defeated. I've been going out a lot, doing well in school, i went on a date the other night...I've been getting closure with people in my past, on new meds, therapy is going well"

"How have you been feeling recently?"
"i have three semesters left"
"How close are you to graduating?"

"I'm tired."
"he gaslights me and verbally abuses me and tells everyone that I do it."
"That's not the best thing to pride yourself on in this situation lol"
"they are. i am just not a complainer because i pride myself on psychological fortitude. However, this merits complaining"
"That's a lot.  I didn't know things were so tumultuous"
"Oh my gosh"
"this aren't great"
"isaac has been very unstable, not gotten meds yet. basically ive been caring for him the whole semester, he dropped all his courses, i got john to agree to meet with him to treat him, i have been taking care of his instructors, he was hospitalized, i was orchestrating everything for him behind the scenes, flying his friends out to console him....I two nights ago ""he wasn't that intelligent anyway and I'm tired of the same old conversation that is not even productive"" well turns out he heard me say that through the door and threw a fit. My friend annie talked to him for about 10 hours and has been spending the weekend with him to figure it out, because he wont listen to me. I fucked a sophomore in a campus restroom and slept in the dorms last night, not i'm in a hotel because i cant go home. i've already been to literally everyones home that i could be to. Annie said it's best if I keep my distance, based on her assessment, but I'm currently not welcome in my own home. I was told even that my face was not something that wanted to be seen in the concert he was performing at."

hahaha
wow
"thats intense"

"so lower does working == good"
"until you cant use it anymore"
"i think that you're going to develop a tolerance and eventually have to raise it eventually"
because
"I would keep it as low as possible"
"Yes. But I have terrible psychosis. I lost my mind. I can't take it lol."

"also depends on what kind of psych you get interested in once you near the end"
"But oh well, state isn't amazing for that anyway. They're a STEM school"
"but that's not the worst thing"

"No one really knows"
"In some cases the evidence SUGGESTS that"
"Is that from development or birth"
"Like, the frontal cortex is smaller"
"No cure"
"And no"
"It's more complicated than that haha but basically that's how it's treated"
"Is there no way to cure adhd?"

"That's what I was thinking"
"He said the bio minor is a good option for a psych deg too"
"He welcomes it haha"
Haha
"Don't know why i didn't think of that"
Okay
"He said to at least"
"Message him on fb haha"
Pls

lol
"our whole life has been psychology just without the academics"
"i mean"
"that sounds up your alley"
"Nothing yet, just gen ed. Not going to declare just yet, I don't think. Still thinking psych"
"What have you decided on?"
"Yea it was a huge weight off. I'm really excited to start next semester though. no math or Chem haha"
"i think that was the best choice. it was too much to deal with right now. give yourself a breather."
"Thank god"
"So o dropped math"
"I forget until I see him"
"I forget he exists until you mention him."
"He is dudes he's tiny"
"""This is charlie. Isn't he small?"""
"so small"
lmfao
"Also Charlie keyser is still so small"
"John sent me an email survey to take"
"That's what my lab manager was saying.  I think it might help me a lot."
"I'd say explore it"
"I think you def have some attention probs because your struggles with school aren't reflective of your brain in my opinion"
"Only if you don't have the issue lol"
"Or something"
"I feel like its cheating"
"Isaac realized he did. It may solve many of your frustrations"
"I messaged John about having an attention problem. My lab manager says it sounds like I do"
No
No
What
Wtf
"What a mess"
"I'm assuming with Hannah"
"Another kid!"
"And just OMG hahahaha"
"Just read through eli Massey's fb"
"the fact that he has made the deans list twice and i have a 2.8 tells me i need to do something else"
"hes never experienced the type of abuse i have"
"and i feel like james tries to be understanding but he really doesnt understand"
"thats what im trying to do but its not looking good.  family stress is keeping me from homework and study, and the two oral surgeries ive had in the last month have messed up a lot of my focus"
Haha
Idk
"But not a lot can be done about the now"
"I know theeeel feel"
"Just try and get through this semester and look forward to a change next semester"
"ive just been sitting here having panic attacks, my chest has been hurting, my eating has gone to shit, all because of some math and chem tests i have this week"
"maaaybe soc but probably not"
"been looking at psych, art"
"Any stand outs?"
"yea i cant afford to fail any more than i have already.  ive been struggling since i started bio"
"ive been looking myself"
"I see"
Yea
Ah
"I'm gonna look through states site and aid you here"
"im at the jumping off point, i dont really have time to ""try"" any classes, because next semester will be chem 2 and if i dont change majors now my gpa is going to go in the trash"
"they always thought you wanted to sell vacuums but really, it was on the inside of them that mattered most to you"
"I'd recommend social or bio psych"
"You should take another class in it"
"You may like psych a whole lot"
"Turns out I like another side of science I do in fact like but they never let me see it"
"i dont like them"
"but it doesnt matter"
"and i feel like theyre going to think im a disappointment"
exactly
"My family's wishes"
"I did neuro because it was consistent with medicine"
Same
"but im slowly learning they dont even know who i am"
"my dad and mindy both have science degrees and my mom has always told me to be a doctor"
"im just tired of failing at things im expected to be good at"
"yea i feel passionless trying to do chem, and this math is hard for me so upper level math would probably be the end of my self esteem"
"I made it into andouboe minor in CSE and neuro. I didn't have any interest at all in my upper level neuro courses or anatomy. I had no passion for it anymore"
"what made you do it?"
"i never heard much about you switching majors"
"I did that wth neuro"
"It's interesting but it's the easiest science if U like science"
"im considering it"
"and now that im realizing the self loathing i feel is not worth a bio degree lol"
"im thinking about it.  thats the one degree ive always sort of gone back and forth on"
"baha okay"
"He's said dismissively ""not at all"""
"does he struggle with it an abnormal amount?"
"He does very much"
"does he enjoy it?  he seems super happy lol"
"Isaac is"
Yes
"Sorry went outside"
"is isaac?"
"do you know people doing psych?"
"i think changing majors would be better than flying to a foreign country and volunteering, which is what some people do to get away from the stress of school lol"
"im not amazing at drawing but i could learn"
"if my homework was drawing, painting, anything with WORDS, i would actually be excited to do it"
"id need 74 more"
"so if i did art with a bio minor i already have 46 of the required credits"
"This is not a bad plan"
"but i could teach with any bachelors degree"
"and i know artists dont really get paid to do anything so thats my only reservation"
"which would be fun to pick"
"no it's not and i can choose those ones, it'd be 9 hours of 300-400 level classes"
"That's not bad !"
"if i were to minor in bio, i would only need 9 more hours"
"she lives half a mile from me"
"no she calls all the time"
"thats not good enough for me"
"my gpa right now is a 2.8"
"Is there no way to at least get her out"
"I don't blame you"
"and i cant get them out of it"
"i CANNOT take these hard courses with them in my life"
Dude
What
"WHAT THE FUCK"
"shes ruining my ability to focus"
"face washes"
"like food and shit"
"and she came into my apartment and took a bunch of stuff back that she gave me"
"all the emotional support i gave her"
"it was a week and she came back, after all the work we did getting her house ready to sell"
"It's been how long?"
"What the fuck"
"did i tell you she moved back?"
"my mom is a psychopath"
"or destroy things"
"because he's crazy and would probably hit me if stuff got bad enough"
"to the point where when hes home im afraid of him"
"lee starts fights with me all the time"
"i cant get them to leave me the fuck alone"
"What's happening there?"
"its stressful enough without them"
"my family really is making this very hard"
"right, i could probably do it, but i would need to move 500 miles away from my family and get tutored 3 hours a day"
"You can but don't want to bad enough to sacrifice yurself at its altar. Like neuro anatomy and I"
"but past the concepts, i cant grasp the nitty gritty"
"and i love animals and the concept of space and time and matter"
"the concepts are great"
"SAME x1000"
"But not if the process is miserable"
"I like presenting work"
"I don't dislike science I just don't like the 9 to 5"
"Same dude"
"i like working with and helping people more than i do working in a lab"
"I feel that."
"to teach kids or do art"
"i feel like theres this creativity inside of me that ive been surpressing"
"i just realized that even if i finish all these classes somehow, and graduate, it's just going to be more of the same when i get a job"
"ill have to see what the requirements are to minor in bio"
"Like how I dropped neuro and minutes instead"
"Minor in biology:"
"I think you are, but maybe this isn't the right college program for you"
"ive just hit this point where i dread studying chemistry, and advanced math makes me feel hopeless"
"i talked to my core lab manager about it and he said he'll support me either way and i can still work in the lab no matter what i study"
"most of them"
"Like some of them or all of them?"
"maybe im not interested in real hard science"
"im only in my sophomore year and thinking about the classes im going to have to take makes me nauseous"
"It sounds you I think"
"You would like that"
"ive been looking at art and education, so far"
"Interesting, to what?"
"im considering switching majors"
so
"That would make it easier"
Yeah
"Ah I see"
"Well hopefully once this is done I can just leave that laptop at James' so I can do homework when I'm visiting."
"that sounds like at least it would be a fun project despite how you ended up iwth a crappy laptop"
"Yeah I would highly rec a solid state. haha"
"Well my laptop is crap, and I had been using the good laptop from the lab, but I stopped doing research and had to give it back. And my old laptop won't connect via hdmi to my TV.  My mom gave me her dell and after looking inside it we concluded we could use some parts and put them in a corsair case, which we did.  and then James surprised me with a new motherboard and processor so all i need now it to eventually update the video card and get a solid state drive, and some more RAM"
"what inspired this?"
"Yea that was my motherboard. Just got a core i5 in the mail this morning."
"that will be fun"
"Oh yes!!! hahaha. I think I saw a photo you posted of that"
"Aw thank you :) I don't forget lol.  but yea we are pretty busy. I'm building a PC! Something i though you would appreciate haha"
"hey, nothing is wrong, but i just wanted to remind you that I love you and I think about you all of the time. Don't forget it. We don't talk as much now because we're both busy, but don't forget that."
"It's been pretty good.  Nothing too special lol. Just ordered some bone collagen on Amazon"
"I hope your days has been fantastic"
"Hey :) thank you!"
"Happy Birthday pal"
"Yes that"
"that my skin is going to be really, really unnecessarily exfoliated?"
HAHA
"That should tell you something"
Hahahaha
"Oh my god how"
"i'm going to use all of it, every day"
"for my birthday, someone got me, the entire kit, like everything that patrick bateman uses in his 'morning routine'"
"dude so get this lol"
"Haha well that should be fun I hope"

"Because my throat chakra is chronically off balance"
"why do you have such bad luck with dental surgery dude"
"jesus christ"
"They think they left a root tip in my bone. Hurts"
"Have to have dental surgery again"
"I'd have to get a loan to get treatment"
"Or as safe"
"Unless I could find it from an actual person and buy it which doesn't seem likely"
"It's also for anxiety and pain and I've been in a lot of pain"
"And Yea i am looking for a way to solve it and I think this can work. I could just do two sessions if i wanted"
"They will normally reimburse some"
"Check into that"
"Unless Insurance can??"
"If you had treatment resistant depression you would be incapacitated and unable to even seek help. You're just very depressed and looking for a way to solve it and I'm really scared this won't do the trick for you because sometimes intermittent depression is harder to treat and I don't want you to spend a whole lot of money"
"I can do it one a day"
"It's in Baltimore $450 a session up to six sessions"
"Because they know some doctors won't consent"
"They said if doctor won't refer there's a form they can sign just saying that he treats me"
"That makes sense"
Interesting
"Baltimore or something. I'll call and ask"
"Where do you have to go?"
"I'll have to call"
"It says online they'll do it without, I think"
"Maybe Canada tho"
"They don't do that stuff without a clinician referral unless you wanna leave the country lol I'm pretty sure"
"I think I can do it without a referral but I'd have to go to a clinic somewhere.  it's already really expensive and insurance doesn't cover it"
"They've ruined my sex life and made me suicidal when I was on them"
"I'd like to just try the IV"
"I don't want to take them against to"
"Well I've been on antidepressants through different doctors"
"He would if he assessed you as resistant to all treatments probably"
"What are you on for depression?"
"If not I would have to travel to Maryland or something"
"Do you think John would help me get that done? A ketamine infusion?"
"I've been researching ketamine IV treatment for depression that is resistant to usual prescribed medications"
"Serious question here, unrelated sort of"
"If I keep on it lol. It's making more sense now.  Except for today my brain is foggy, took mom to airport."
"If those are your scores you will do just fine on the exam ect ect"
"Don't sweat it"
"Your prob gonna be just fine"
"This is one misstep"
"Oh wow ok"
"Bad for both of us lol.  Don't fall asleep on a book. Got 19/20 and 20/20 on my stuff last week. Hoping I can keep the momentum"
"Or myself"
"Yeah I'm not gonna put you in thisnpoisotion again"
"Well I as usual it's another example of me stretching myself so thin that I fall asleep on a book trying to feel righteous lolol"
"Yea dude if you can't do it just tell me lol. I was even thinking, wow he can do that? Sounds like he's super busy already"
"I am always avilable to assist I think in the future I just need to be more reasonable with what I have time to do and let you know if I can't and realize that you aren't gonna condemn me if I say no or I can't lol"
"It's okay. I'll make sure to do better next week.  Thanks for trying to help"
"I just had less free time than I thought"
"Tried to do too much at once because I knew you had been doing well and didn't want your mother to cause you to fall behind"
"I like"
"I didn't know it would take so long"
No
"I understand"
"I'm sorry I asked too much"
"Onto wouldn't have agreed"
"The amount of stress I've been under this week has been literally crazy.  I did really well on my math last week and am really trying to keep doing well."
"I thought I could"
"I am just sorry I couldn't finish in time"
"Well that's okay dude. I just wasn't clear on how severe of a position you were in until this moment"
"I get that dude but understand the position I am in as well.  I'm not speaking to you in any way I wouldn't speak to anyone else.  Trying to state facts, sorry if it's coming across any way."
"I would ask you to Just read this back to yourself and see if you're okay with the way you're speaking to me. I'm literally doing my best to help you with school and I'm not expecting money or anything other than feeling like I'm not a part of a transaction or a bargain and I just want help and I would have done it without the money. I have a hard time not helping when asked by anyone most of the time unfortunately"
"It's no big deal, just saying"
"Well if you can't do it in time no reason to try anyway"
"You know I wasn't gonna say no and I'm happy to help, I'll totally send it back dude"
"Unless you want to finish it and i can see if I'll get some points if I email it in later today"
"It's no big deal I'll just take the zero.  If you could send that $15 back I'd appreciate it"
"I told you by 10 am this morning"
"I stayed up until like 1 doing that and my own work in tandem. The date says ""the week of 9/16"" on it it's not a big deal I just thought I had more time to finish it is all and didn't know it was to be turned in this morning. I thought the sheet said by tonight"
"I didn't put it off for two weeks.  I put it off for one night because I had to help my mom."
"Well you could have looked at it when I sent the assignment and said it was too much.  Or told me before my class what was going on."
"It was a ridiculous amount of work that you put off for two weeks and I had a 9 am. I sort of just thought it was a small assignment. I couldn't get it all finished also I thought it was due tonight not this morning so I goofed up ._. Agh"
"I have class in less than an hour"
"You got that?"
"Okay bub"
"I just got back from the gym, calc project, then I can start"

"You're an angel. Thank you.  Doing yoga rn. Will look it over after :)"
"i am sending you the sheet I used"
"you got a perfect score"
"thanks bub.  i did really well in lab today though.  doing stuff makes it easier."

"i will do that"
ok

also
lol
"because these things come back in more advanced bio"

"i think our issues with chem may have been similar conceptually"
"or even one"
"give me two questions  you don't understand, and I'll write them out step by step in a way i'm certain the both of us would understand in the next 15 minutes, and if it doesn't help then i'll do it and just explain later because it is a grade"

"you do that"
"but it's not hard to pass if you work"
"so many people fail"
"I'm switching what I'm doing, and only because not failing chem gave me the confidence to feel like i could do anything in science"
"ive started taking a xanax just to do my hw"
"right haha"
"Math + anything science is hard"
"it is"
"because really your grade depends on the grades of those around you and vise versa...that is if you're working harder you get an advantave"
"its really hard doing chem and math at once though"
"i guess i just need to study"
"just think of it as your safety ney"
right
"but don't rely on the curve"
"sometimes the curve is 10-15%"
"So often."
Yes.
"does that happen often? people fail but still pass"
HUGE
"Once you get through general chemistry you'lll feel like you can do anything. It's a HUGE confidence boost if you can get through"
"a failing grade doesn't actually fail you in the class"
"sometimes it's just hard, and"
"by the time i get to chem II I have the confidence to get in the C range, above everyone else, without a curve"
"so story ends like..."
"that doesn't mean you'll fail"
"you may get a failing point value"
"c+ rather"
"like all i can think about it failing"
"i got a c+ and a c- in chemistry and so do 60% of the people who take it. they get a C. and the funny part is, that's with a curve. in my first chem course, I got a 59%. Everyone else was struggling just as bad as I was. it became a c-"
"its been making me really depressed"
"no you shouldn't"
"you need to try and power through it and accept you may have to work a bit harder just to get your head in a non anxious space. it's not about not knowing it, it's about getting in your own way and stopping your brain from aiding that"
"like i should get a communicatoins degree"
"like it makes me question my field of study"
yes
"due to its effect on you"
"like you dont work on it much"
"i'm guessing there is avoidance"
"but it's how people typicaly get over math anxeity"
"i know thats really simple logic"
"the solution is to force yourself through the anxiety. just this one time. stop the cycle. you wont be anxious if you eventually figure it out."
so
"I see."
"its very hard for me"
"my focus wanders"
"because i dont know what im doing and i get antsy and i have math anxiety"
lol
"not the hating it"
"the prior"
wel
"why is that?"
"i hate it"
"hard for me to dedicate time to it"
"exactly.  thats why im not doing great at math"
"and over.."
"repetition, like just doing problems over and over and over"
"it's about"
"chem is not about studying in the way you know"
"so its a problem"
"im really bad at studying"
well
"hahaha okay"
"end of secret."
"literally every single person who takes chemistry says that within three weeks."
go
"here is a big secret"
"i dont know if im cut out for the science life"
"it's a beast"
"oh yes"
"chemistry is hard"
so
"right haha"
"only bird law"
"i dont understand the law"
"who knows fam"
"haha whats the point"
"god damn"
"a bill was passed but will not go into effect for a looooong time"

"how can i tell"
omg
"the progeny has propagated and all they can catch is worms, well one of them is wAAAAYYY worse but the other isn't fantastic but can still catch crickets"
"Are they blind?"
"they CANT"
"they CANT catch crickets man"
"they suck at hunting"
Hahahahaha
"they are both weird"

Hahahahahaha
lmao
Hahahahaha
"and enjoyed it"
"he did"
"Mine never did"

"I was schizotypal and obsessive"
"But really"
"I used to be enlightened and eat a perfect diet"
Likw
"And it actually distracts from current reality to wish for an old self"

"ive let myself deviate a bit"
"want to focused"
"happy focused"
"And when you start doing stuff because you want to, you stop feeling guilty about doing things"
"like about two year ago"
"I used to be that"
"Well not just that.  It's not about asserting yourself or trying to be a leader. Just focus on being happy.  Everything else falls into place when you're doing things because you enjoy them"
"and people will look to that"
"like assert myself as a leader, or even jsut confident in my OWN dealings"
"that makes sense"
"i get that much though"
yeah
#thirst
"(Thirst haha)"
"If you become a stable person and happy, people will start following you and listening to you because they will thirst for what you have"
"they want to feel right"
"is that even advice"
"they cherry pick what you say"
"People don't listen, but they will imitate"
"just want to hear what they want"
"they sometimes"
"ohhhhhh this is so true"
"They want to see and follow"
"People often do not want advice"
yas
"Here's a secret"
"which is skewed thinking i think"
"not the other way around"
"people rely on me"
"so it feels like shit to ask for advice"
"I've always been the one who helped"
"i just feel so, helpeless"
"that makes sense"
"After that, it's just self work"
"It jump started it for me"
"It really does just take time.  I'm telling you, the biggest thing you can do to start the process of becoming calm and happy is removing people who cause you stress and worry"
"i try my best to do that"
"But at the end of every day I make myself think about all the great things in my life and feel grateful for them, and then try again the next day"
"i'm crying whilst studying"
"like today"
"me too"

"i'm just at a loss, dude"
"but you're so correct"
lol
"i feel like i was giving you this advice like two years ago"
"the irony is"
"you're right"
"Desperation is not love, and they're probably just desperate"
"And often you'll find that those people are some of the people you need to get our of your life.  They're clinging to you because you give them attention."
"but not playing into it"
"i've got to change that"
"everyone treats me like a pyschotherapist"
"you're right"
"no one else is my responsibility"
"""Stop being responsible for anyone besides yourself"""
"Tell them you love them but they need to get a therapist"
"that is the best advice i could give myself"
"i need to strategize a bit"
"Stop being responsible for anyone besides yourself"
"i just needed to read it"
"im having a slight crisis lol"
"its seeming to be a bit much"
"i'm responsible for all my friends depressions, life crises, problems. i am also responsible for getting good grades and working hard"
"Yes I know lol."
"ect ect"
"it's different if you say it"
"but as you know"
"i know it"
"I just needed to hear all of this"
"It can just be done.  It's a conscious decision.  Don't answer that text.  Unfriend them.  Block if you have to. Stop talking to or about them. Just disassociate yourself from that or those people."
"because i*"
"becausei  need fade"
"or can it just be done"
"is it easier said than done?"
"just fade?"
"i honestly just need help. i don't know who else to turn to. no one knows me as well. I've taken on everyones issues as my own, and im trying to focus more on school. so much expectation"
"It's easier to get rid of the weight of people.  You have to exit them from your life.  Just let them fade away if they take away from you in a way that you can't justify."
"well of course. i would be shocked if it wasn't still a little"
"Well, it's still there a lot of the time. I still have anxiety.  But the difference is, I fight it now."
"i know you well enough to know you did it"
"the weight of other people"
"because i know you did"
"i only ask"
"how did you learn to get the weight of the world off of your shoulders"
"Very loooow sounds haha"
"We listened to giraffe noises a couple months ago"

"of course"
"Thanks dude"
good
"I'll set it up this week"

"it's probably a work in progress"

"i had to face the wall"
"my first intimate talk with isaac"
"i mean"
"i see"
yeah
"well those are pretty needed haha"
"Unless he really has something to say"
"He avoids deep intimate talks sometimes"
"I think he would give a cop out answer"
Hahahaha
haha
"because that's a thing people do"
"unless he's the type to instantly feel like those are leading questions and be like ""I'm not drinking too much"""
"I think maybe asking him something related to the drinking rather than about the drinking itself could help. Such as ""What's on your mind?"" ""have you had an alright day?"" ""What are ya thinking about"""
well
hmmm
"Or he's autistic"
"Like its been seething"
"i see"
ahhh
"its a good defense"
"When he finally gets upset enough to address things he does it in such a tactless manner"
"i get it a little bit"
"I answered questions like james does with you"
"Wow haha Yea I could see that in James"
lol
"therapy fixed it. It was fear of communication"
"That's awesome dude!"
yeah
"Has your drinking gotten better?"
"Right haha"
lol
"obviously, well"
"he's probably strugggling with it in his own way"
"and no progress is made"
"if you keep bringing it up"
"that's tricky though"
"therapy fixed that one for me lol"
"which is maybe why he drinks? if so i get that"
Maybe.
"maybe he just doesn't wanna talk about it"
"He's not retarded"
"He knows it isn't good"
"even if its anger"
"in some way"
"Yea that's what I've been doing"
"he needs to respond"
"maybe keep asking"
"Yea I know"
"i mean"
"that's a little heavy"
"but gin"
"I mean i'll have a glass of wine, maybe a half a glass when I'm winding down in the evening sometimes"
Gin
"He drinks him and tonic normally"
"i don't know how to articulate this"
Yes
"""amount"""
"an amount"
like
"like more than like half a glass of wine"
Yes
"but every night"
"Sometimes six"
"It's two to four normally"
"or is it 6"
Always
"is it two though"
"But he drinks every night"
"He's like ""oh Yea my two drinks before bed"""
"He doesn't really say anything"
"what does he say?"
"I don't like James' drinking and I mention it to him"
"i think"
"that's usually the issue in relationships"
"Yea this is true"
"they build up"
"LITTLE Thing are worse than big things"
"That's awesome"
"the thing is"
"so well. we were able to, with no fear of backlash, address our issues, and then get suggestions and objective feed back"
"How did that go?"
"i brought isaac into a session with me"
"i am in therapy and its helped a lot"
"i do the same thing"
"Which points to my lack of self worth"
"And I think it's because I want validation"
"I have been doing better.  But he pointed out that when I am away from him for a few days I start picking fights and getting offended, which is sort of true"
"do you feel like you need to? or was it just a fight"
"your self confidence and worth has been better than before. I mean neither of us have great, that, but I feel like you've been doing better with that"
"i feel like as of late"
"i mean"
"you cant use it as leverage in a fight. that's a sign you ALSO may need it haha"
BUT
"even if theres no issue"
"but it helps"
"therapy never hurt anyone"
"thats the thing"
"That's my conclusion. I told him i need to, and he said maybe see a therapist"
"was the implication?"
"you need to build self worth?"
like
"oh wow"
"Build self worth"
"James and I had a stupid argument that resulted in him telling me in draining him and i need to do something like see a therapist"
"I'm okay now I thi k"

"Just stop being a cynic. Appreciate everything. The odds that you can experience life as a person are so small that everything is like a blessing"
"it's helpful"
"I appreciate the insights"
"but she didn't help"
"it's not her fault totally"
"I think lea sort of put me into that"
"that's true"
"When you got into something you actually cared whereas now you'd be like ""life is a joke who cares"""
"that's also true"
Like
"Seems like you cared more about things"
"THATS IT"
"You were more childlike"
idk
"maybe more of a ""brain"" ""personal"" thing"

"that's helping me too"
"And staying busy"
"I guess a good question would be like...Before then. When..I hate to bring this up. But when you and that racist mutant were dating, I hung out with you. I was happy. I changed. What did you see change in me?"
"Was focusing on goals"
"Because I was also very miserable"
"One thing that helped me a lot"
"Hm. Probably has something to do with drinking and some drug use.  Environment. Stability."
"we talked on the phone some"
"I know that's when you were in VA beach"
"well I was happy until about the middle of the relationship. We both were. So I think it's definitely involved but I think there is a greater reason otherwise the misery would have started at a more consistent time in the relationshi"
"So you were happy until you started dating Isaac for a few months is what you're saying"
"I miss that person"
"and any help you can offer, will help me via therapy and self reflection get back to me. The actual me"
"I'm just trying to figure this out, because you know I've changed a bit"
"you don't have to have a real response"
"think back to...summer 2014 to like december 2014.  I was happy. I had just started dating isaac. I was VERY focused on school. I was a little bit of a dork. I was a weirdo. An introvert. 

Now I'm a cynic. I'm a bully. I'm an ass. I don't care much about school. I'm not even outgoing, I just seek validation and people mistake social neediness for extraversion and sociability. People used to find me charming, people would describe me as a ""nice boy."" Now People often find me hard to be around. 


SOMETHING within that time frame HAPPENED and I don't for the life of me know what i was, but I'm trying to recreate old scenarios to figure out how i ended up so miserable, when I was so very happy"

"That sounds very sad"
:(
"It sounded sad"
"Exactly. He wrote in his journal that I invited him twice to go to Ohio with me but that he declined because he doesn't leave his house"
"you'd have seen it by now right??"
"if that part of him was there"
"that would raise an eyebrow for me"
yeah
"At least as I know him"
"Like, I'm looking at this poster of all the things he's done and his plane tickets and stuff and they just are not representative of who he is"
"that's a good idea"
"I'm gonna ask him if he's feeling okay when he gets back home "
"i think you're fine"
"you don't know what else to do"
"yeah i mean"
"I feel like a literal demon for telling you this but whatever I need your help because I care about him and I don't know what to do "
"Then in one he's like, did some stuff on the dock today, feeling kind of anxious, lonely tonight and then put a sort of sad face at the top of the page "
Etx
"He was like, she hung out with me but she was distant.  Made me feel even more weird than I know I already am. "
"In one he hung out with his Junkie ex, ashtin. The one I ran into when she was pulling out of his driveway "
"The entries were like"
Anyway
Hahahahahahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Omg
"IM SCREAMING!!!"
"Also JAMES IF YOUVE MASTERED NETWORKING TO THE POINT OF GETTING INTO MY PHONE THEN HA IVE GOTTEN YOU BEAT"
"And they were pretty depressing. Until I came along."
"OMG this makes sense.  I read his journal. He wrote five entries right before he met me and the weekend he met me and then nothing else. "
"And I don't think he would ever admit to not being perfect "
"How would I even ask that "
"that's an interesting question to ask, to be honest"
"He doesn't seem depressed unless he's always been depressed"
"Hm...but he's always prancing around, making weird noises, singing, quips and puns, etc "
"that could cause depression"
honestly
"He was an addict so they won't give him amphetamines "
"And he took stratera ""for focus"" and it made him unable to perform sexually so he sent it back "
"""For focus"""
"He started talking welbutrin "
"You think he's depressed?"
"Yesterday he said he felt tired "
"he seems depressed"
""
"Like, look at this. Yesterday I asked him to go to Ben's birthday thing with me and he NEVRR goes to family things with me, and this is how he reacted"
"He won't leave the house "
"Like James doesn't take me to dinner, we don't go anywhere "
"I'm just sad and feeling unfulfilled "
"It's gone down a lot "
"That's possible but my heart rate is pretty damned good recently, resting, that is "
"i think that stress could be a huge part of this"
hm
"Not like me "
"I should have started my period last week, took a pregnancy test, not pregnant. Feel irritable and nauseous "

"shes a witch"
"SO MUCH"

YESSSSSSSSS
GOOOOOOOD
"so much"
"i love azealia banks"
also
"i think hes just being whiney"
"i mean he basically is fine"
"that's why I was confused"
"i totally thought he'd done it with you and been fine"
ok
"oh my gosh"
"But he drinks every night...."
Afterwards
"Because he says it makes him feel tired and foggy"
"why won't he do it?"
Are
"Because you know how they ate"
"It's hard being with another addict "
"But he still does adderral every once in awhile "
"I want him to do this Molly with me because he really opens up when we do but he says he doesn't want to and we've had it for over a month "
"i feel like it's not much"
"And I don't want to be a bitch about getting what I want but I feel like I'm not asking much"
"yes && yes"
"Yea :/ I just really like this relationship but at the same time I'm not going to settle because there are dudes who would treat me like a queen "
"he has to see at least one"
"I'm not sure"
"or you'll just fall into anxiety and it will suck"
"It seems like you have like a lot of really important concerns about the relationship. I feel like you may need to just pick his brain about all of these."
"Okay so"
"He seems fine "
"Which scares me because it almost seems as if he doesn't particularly have feelings to address"
"Weve just stopped talking about our feelings "
"Or not even that "
"But it seems like our communication has broken down or something "
"Or something "
"Then he'll get his feelings hurt "
"Right "
"like they won't even see it"
"that's actually sort of a scary thought, and I often have i before addressing mutual concerns."
"And then I'll be the alienated Jack ass"
"OH no"
"The sex is fine "
"He will be like, what are you talking about "
" My fear is that "
idk
"just think about how you're gonna word it well before hand maybe?"
"but i think that may answer the question more than google can. google wiill just give you anxiety. haha"
"yeah i understand"
"Yea I guess I don't like approaching stuff like this with words. I'm afraid I'll get my feelings hurt. "
haha
"but first figure out the best way to word this"
"have a conversation about it?"
"maybe like"
"it sort of seems like that reason is a stretch, i'm sure it's not that"
"But I want to cry about it"
"I don't know "
"It almost feels like because I was doing so well and now I'm not, he might be thinking that it's a waste of time because I'm not getting where I used to, and he may be blaming himself "
"Then I stopped a few months ago, started getting stuck in my head again"
"I used to function super well when we had sex "
"Here's what I'm thinking "
"I don't know "
"could it be the overexposure/familiarity?"
"And it's just sort of awkward almost "
so
"oh wow"
"Now its for like twenty minutes, used to be like an hour "
"I started loving here, and we started having sex less and less. Now it's like once every three days, where it was normally once or twice a day"
"what happened?"

Just now Â· 
I`am a trash person. I`am a sociopath,and this status is not an apology,it's a warning.
I`am a threat to every community.
I will preach love,acceptance and ""spiritual awakening"",but the depth and sincerity only has to do with the highs I seek, the people who can procure it and people who will enable my actions.
I`am a known addict and it has NO bounds .
I will betray good hearted people,I am known to ask underage girls to prostitute for drugs ,because I believe adulthood happens when mammary glands develop.
Being a addict is a disease,but my deficiencies go further than addiction, it's a lack of moral and grit. 
A lack of basic principles just to be a decent person .
I have no morals and will put anyone in harms way without consideration as long as there is personal gain .
So this is your warning , at the end of the day I'm a addict , pedophile, liar and thief .
I lack the ability to feel !
So this is me saying

"Patty, I appreciate the articles, but I'm super duper busy this semester and don't have time to read them all. Also, they all seem to be about things that I don't really line up with. I'm not going to change because of a couple of blog posts. .If you'd like to talk to me about them/some of your thoughts I'd be more than happy to listen I just can't keep up with these articles. Some of them (The one's I have caught up with) really just seem to be a couple of sentences and no content.

Love you!
you too.

It's okay--I'm just saying o love you and that God loves you even though you do not accept that in your life right now--He's always there for you and so are we.  Love you!!
Well I appreciate that. And It's not that I don't accept that a god couldn't love me, or that I reject religion entirely. I just think it's sort of insulting for you to try and posit that there's some sort of previsionary wisdom provided by being a person of faith; i.e. ""you do not accept that in your life RIGHT NOW"" sort of implies I'm being naive and will later ""come to accept your way of thinking.""  That's incredibly insulting. But I'm really sorry but I don't see that happening, despite how much I wish I could relate to you on this. I respect your beliefs as I hope you will respect mine. And not try to change them. I do not send you articles trying to deconstruct your faith.
Do not misinterpret that as me being defensive; I just wanted you to know how these things are interpreted.
And how they make me feel

I do accept your beliefs-- but the power of God goes out to you because I love you and ask him to take care of you, to lift up your life as you obviously want by you studying and seeking greater knowledge. It is not my intention to insult you, only to share my caring for you which from me is asking God to guide you and be with you.
Well I thank you for that, and if that's your way of caring that is fine. I'd just prefer not to receive clips of people like Ben Carson talking, people that with their hateful speech of made people like me feel small and worthless. That is not god. I would argue that using god as a tool to make people feel small, is just satan wearing a mask with gods face painted on it.
has made*

I understand. I love you and want you to have a good day and good week. I will not send things that may make you feel badly.
Thank you. You too.

"the power of the sun"
"see the pattern here"
exactly
right?
b
"When a photon is absorbed by a molecule, the photon
  A. loses its ability to generate any energy. 	
  B. raises the molecule from a ground state of low energy to an excited state. 	
  C. affects the molecule in ways that are not clearly understood. 	
  D. causes a change in the velocity of the wavelengths. 	
  E. makes the molecule more stable."
awesome
"C I believe yep"
c?
"When hydrogen ions are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix across the inner membrane into the intermembranous space, the result is the
  A. formation of ATP. 	
  B. reduction of NAD+. 	
  C. creation of a proton gradient. 	
  D. restoration of the sodium-potassium balance across the membrane. 	
  E. reduction of glucose to lactic acid."
"almost done"
yes
yes
"yes haha"
"the sugar splitting"
Yes
wait
yeah
"Oh yay"
right?
"begins with glycolisis"
"glucose metabolism"
haha
"so there ya go"
"Well photosynthesis works the same way"
"genius, i thought that but i thought it was just the elctrons that got excited"
"Okay this is basic chem. Something absorbs a photon, it ALWAYS goes from a ground to excited state. So A"
"or just e"
"and e"
d?
"When a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll,
  A. the chlorophyll becomes ""excited,"" or energized. 	
  B. a greater number of light wavelengths can be absorbed. 	
  C. ATP is split into ADP, phosphate, and energy. 	
  D. hydrogen ions are released. 	
  E. the chlorophyll molecules fluoresce."
transfering
"bam bam bam bam"
yes
"making bonds releases energy"
"like a chain"
"It's always the redox reactions"
D
"or d?"
nadph?
"During electron transport, the energy to produce ATP is provided by
  A. heat. 	
  B. NADPH. 	
  C. ground-state chlorophyll. 	
  D. the reactions of the electron transport chain. 	
  E. the Calvin cycle."
okay
"i think it's two"
"i wanna say 6"
"During the fermentation of one molecule of glucose, the net production of ATP is _______ molecule(s).
  A. one 	
  B. two 	
  C. three 	
  D. six 	
  E. eight"
"next one"
"yay okay"
"pumping away"
"it's the pumps"
"always make that connections"
"Yes electrons-->ions"
a?
lol
"10 leftThe hydrogen ion gradient is maintained by
  A. electron transport and proton pumping. 	
  B. the splitting of water. 	
  C. the ionization of glucose. 	
  D. ATP synthase. 	
  E. acetyl CoA."
"just lemme know when we're done"
"when this quiz is over"
"I have something that may be of use to you"
"Ok neat"
"thank you"
"well go further into that some other time so i understand fully but yes okay"
"NADPH and ATP. The H+ is just an electron carrier and the photons are converted. The actual energy is from the NADPH and ATP"
"this one got me twisted"
"The energy source for the synthesis of carbohydrates in the Calvin cycle is
  A. ATP only. 	
  B. photons. 	
  C. energized chlorophyll a. 	
  D. NADPH + H+. 	
  E. NADPH and ATP."
"awesome then"
"it def takes place in the mitochondrion"
"It oxidizes carbon i think"
"i want to say c"
"The citric acid cycle
  A. has no connection with the respiratory chain. 	
  B. takes place in the mitochondrion. 	
  C. reduces two NAD+ for every glucose processed. 	
  D. produces no ATP. 	
  E. is the same thing as fermentation."
"i knew it just making sure"
yes
correct?
"is wavelengths"
"the different between red and blue light"
"yeah I think that's it"
"i thought 6 too"
"but I'm leaning toewards 6"
"it's eihther 6 or 12"
"6 moles I believe"
"How many moles of CARBON DIOXIDE must enter the Calvin cycle for the synthesis of one mole of glucose?
  A. 1 	
  B. 2 	
  C. 3 	
  D. 6 	
  E. 12"
OXIDIZED
"A. reduced. 	
  B. oxidized. 	
  C. redoxed. 	
  D. hydrogenated. 	
  E. hydrolyzed."
"When a molecule loses hydrogen atoms (as opposed to hydrogen ions), it becomes"
"this is helping me so much"
seriously
"side note we need to study bio together"
"yes thank you"
"NADPH acts as an oxidizing agent"
C
"or e"
"i think this is also c"
"In the light reactions, electrons from _______ replenish chlorophyll molecules that have given up electrons.
  A. carbon dioxide 	
  B. water 	
  C. NADPH + H+ 	
  D. O2 gas 	
  E. carbohydrates"
exactery
"it's ANAEROBIC"
"YAY GOT ONE"
YEP
c?
"Fermentation
  A. takes place in the mitochondrion. 	
  B. takes place in all animal cells. 	
  C. does not require O2. 	
  D. requires lactic acid. 	
  E. prevents glycolysis."
"we good"
"we're good"
"i got the question mixed around in my head"
"okay then haha"
"All of these choices are O-K"
"the MOST incorrect answer is that it's a protein"
"I think"
"and it's not a protein"
"it is reduced"
"well it's not the end product"
a?
"no wait"
"but im not sure"
"i thought it was b"
"it's a sugar"
"well it's not a protein"
"Which statement about pyruvate is false?
  A. It is the end product of glycolysis. 	
  B. It becomes reduced during fermentation. 	
  C. It is a precursor of acetyl CoA. 	
  D. It is a protein. 	
  E. It contains three carbon atoms."
haha
"I'm like 90% sure"
"awesome haha"
"More ATP"

  A. more ATP. 	
  B. pyruvate. 	
  C. fewer protons for pumping in the mitochondria. 	
  D. less carbon dioxide. 	
  E. more oxidized coenzymes."
"gotcha haha"
"okay starting now"
right
lol
"but answers would be helpful"
"not a life or death thing"
"will do"
ok

"I'm sorry"
"That definitely sounds like depressed to me"
"Its Tuesday.   And I know dude. I miss you a lot. I've just been trying to get high when im not at work, and sleep.  I guess technically im depressed but its more of a feeling of stagnation. "

"whats up friend"
"Hey there"
hi
"will do"
"Let me know how it goes"
"Well okay "
Damn!
"and if not, ill go to marshall"
"so i am going to see if there is any way for me to get into state for the fall"
"does not transfer"
"so the act i took at marshall"
"Okay on it."
"Send me photos. Now that they are dehydrated they may not sell as easily. It may be best of i take  sonny and sal"
"What do i need to do to sell matts reptiles? Photos, then what?"

"No dude ACT is a national thing and even if it's through marshall marshall would just be the testing site. I'd double check but I think you can access your scores and send them online"
"So I dont think the website would have it"
"I tested through marshall"
"but that's how you send act scores usually"
"if you don't know your login you can create an account"
"it's a couple bucks"
"and have the scores sent to state"
login
"is go to actstudent.org"
"Well what you need to do"
"Monday I am taking them all my stuff, I just have to call marshall and get my act scores"
"what all do you still need to get sent over there?"
"yeah don't sweat that haha"
"That sounds great"
"Oh well cool then haha"
"they still have your records"
"I didn't [ay for 2 years"
"if you can come up with money for the class they will give you credit"

"the first course required for a psych major"
plus
"The psych I've taken I've enjoyed"
"my degree requires some psych"
"It could be fun"
"I am quite excited about this possibility"
"It will give you a nice mix of social science and hard science"
"I honestly would suggest a BS"
"It will be harder but I want to learn"
"Hmmm well I do want science courses"
opportunities*
"and may have research opportunities"
"A BS probably requires more specialized upper level psych courses as well"
"That's with any BA and BS"
"a BA is mroe writing, literature, english, that kinda stuff, a BS is more math, biology, chemistry"
"it's the approach to college in general"
"It's not the approach to psych"
"well let me rephrase"
"So one degree is maybe more focused on feelings and social communication and one is more on chemistry etc"
lol
"it's just like, do you wanna take biology"
"It doesn't matter career wise long term at all"
"so that would be up to you"
"I think they offer both"
"Either a BA or a BS. Psych is a social science. BA is more of a soft approach, BS is more of a hard science approach"
"What bachelors is it"
"So what would the steps be towards getting a psych degree"
"Yeah exactly"
"Which I could take a a transfer student at Marshall anyways "
"that's the only way it could go south"
"So state would be fine unless you wanna end up in a specific place and need a course state cant offer"
"I would probably tell you it doesn't matter until you get close to graduation. Different clinical psych programs require different prerequisite course for entrance, so at some point just look at where you want to end up and make sure that you can take the courses that they ask"
"but anyways"
"so there ya go"
"Well you have to do both to become a psychologist anyway"
"Maybe both"
?
"So like clinical psychology, not like research psychology. I.e. seeing clients"
"I want to help people the way I wish someone could have helped me. And own my own practice. "
"either answer is fine"
"do you have any idea what you wanna do with a psych degree or are you not looking past that yet?"
"Ok well let me ask you this to figure out how to answer this..."
"I dont know much about how this works"
"If they dont have that many classes could I still get a psych degree there?"
"which is behavioral neuroscience which I've taken and i really enjoyed it"
"they do have a physiological psych course"
"they just don't have that many classes"
"eh it's not as bad as I thought"
"Please do because I think biopsych or social psych would be so much fun"
"I'll look at it again and make sure it hasn't updated"
"Their psych curriculum is just bad. It isn't diverse. It doesn't give what it should."
"I would really need to find another school?"
"Why would it be so bad at state? "
"You would like social psych and biopsych"
"Psych is really interesting, and you would like it, but it can be a real bullshit degree. So if you want to study it, find a way to end up at marshall, or somewhere else, because you won't get a good psych education from state. You can get a good bio education from state though. So you could definitely do that no problem. But if you are really interested in psych, you gotta look elsewhere"
"Here's my opinion on that"
"Should I study psychology? "
"I am watching social psychology ted talks and now I am conflicted"
"I see your car"
Underestimated
"Its a long walk lol"

"Be there in 5"

"I truly do need the hours, believe that if I felt capable of being helpful I would be more than happy to come in."
"and then"
"I understand that.  If I had known earlier that this was going to happen, I would have certainly let someone know."
"i said after that"
"This is false for any human"
"Like that was odd of him to say. Like you cant control certain things. Like his statement operates on the assumption that you can control extraneous events and cater your life to your work schedule "

"You need to figure out where you stand with josh and what to do about it."
"You are miserable at your fathers. You love josh. You hate that you love him but you love him. You would rather be living with him. You weren't miserable because of him you were miserable despite him. You want to learn. You want to work at butter it up. You need to make some change to accommodate all your wants and needs."
"and you need to find a way to deal with them that best suits your needs"

what
dude
"he is screaming and crying"
"and they are yelling at him"
"i pay for everything myself. they dont even buy me food."

"he thinks he is special"
"he wont get a job because all of my parents have fucked him in the head"
jesus

"he is screaming and crying"
"they are screaming at lee"
"my hands have gone blue"
"But for now i need it"

Acceptance
"Love is"
"It has to be something if it inspires you"
"What is it?"
"but like"
"in every sense you know"
"I try so hard"
"I don't understand what the word love even means"
"I resent it"
"because I want it but I don't even think I know what it is"
"So I dont know what will inspire you"
"love angers me"
"You think im crazy for that I think"
"Is magic, love, etc "
"what inspires you"
"i guess"
"case and point, saying random words in the middle of conversations about serious things"
"The thing that inspires me"
"I should not do that"
"there is that"
"You are not inspired to help yourself"
"Oh yeah"
"But you have a habit of not caring"
Sharknado
"You're right"
"That is inspiring in itself"
"you're right"
"But we cant give up. You dont have to be inspiring. You just have to not slip up yourself. "
"I'm not a very inspiring person most times"
"Yes. Because we are unstoppable together."
"As a team"
"We worked together"
"What if"
"I have always needed you to help lift me up the way I try to help you when I can"
"I just had a swig of it"

"good point"
"Dont focus on what doesn't."
"Avoid avoidance. Focus on doing what brings you joy and calm. "
"I think there's a difference right"
"or do I avoid what brings me pain?"
"I need to focus on what makes me happy to create happiness, and avoid what does not make me happy"

"I dont remember the last time i was truly happy. Im very good at convincing myself i am"

"Im still pondering it. If it happens it will probably be spontaneous. But the thought cant and wont leave my mind"
"But if you are wanting to die because you feel disconnected, the mystery can be less comforting than it is alienating"
"I enjoy the mystery really"
"I dont need to know everything about how things work"

Haha
""
"So the physical(brain) and spiritual(mind) bodies are connected at birth.  As we allow the world to wear on us and we make decisions, the two become somewhat separated.  We start doing things because the body wants it, and we damage the mind, and vice versa.   When a person is able to disassociate through drugs or traumatic events, heavy meditation, etc, it sort of peels the mind and body apart so you can examine, like opening the hood on a car, what happens to the body if the mind does this, or what happens to the mind if the body experiences this.  From there, often you cannot ""balance"" or ""undisassociate"" very well unless you listen to what harmonizes with both the mind and the body.  It will eventually become one again, but it takes a very long time if you are still eating taco bell and smoking cigarettes.   I believe dissociation is the mind leaving the body as self preservation. When the body is in good shape again, the mind will return."
"Now this I can talk on haha"
"I'm getting a good outline here"
"is there a divide between mind and brain/body?"
"here's the question of the year"
now
"Got it"
Alright
"Could I be buried 6 feet under in another dimension?  Were my near death experience ""near"" death, or were they death?"
"Which brings me to my biggest question that i have not been able to figure out"
"Im in my bed messaging you right now, but in another reality i could be dancing or something haha"
"Since every possibility exists in space time,  nothing is pre destined unless you perform an action or make a choice that sets that outcome in stone.  But even then I believe you can change the outcome. I think in that case, the seemingly unrealistic change in outcomes would be what some refer to as a ""miracle"", and we all know there are no miracles,  just really strong will power used in the right way at the right moment"
"Logical fatalism"
"But with the thing before"
"It is totally relative.  Good for me is terrible for some other life form.  Yes, I got over the cold, but I also killed the life forms that caused my cold,  which is unfortunate for their cause."
"I just need more"
"the example is good"
"Also I'd like you to talk more about what you just said. Like minus the example"
"Is there a good and is there an evil?"
"It is not fixed.  This is where positive and negative energy come into play a bit more.  When I am following ""right action"", the rootbeer will or will not be consumed and it won't matter because you dont ponder things like not getting a soda when you're in the best mind state. However, lets say I'm not supposed to drink the soda.  Ill use a real life example here. I had a gram of heroin once.  Everything I did to get that bag made my life harder and harder,  the universe did not want me to have that bag. With each action towards the bag, something ""bad"" was inflicted on my current situation, until finally I got the bag...and then driving home I hit a deer and did substantial damage to my car.  The day after, when the dope had been consumer, I went into immediate heavy dope sickness.  I chose to do the wrong thing for physical pleasure and in my ""good"" universe, it would not have happened. I had to delve deeper into shittier planes to get the dope, and it took me days to work through the chain of bad events that caused, and then I was returned to a good level place to stop dealing with the consequences of that particular chain of decisions."
"Iis everything fixed?"
"How can we account for change and choice if everything necessarily will or won't happen?"
"Either you will drink a root beer tomorrow, or you will not (from the law of excluded middle);
If you will drink a root beer tomorrow, then nothing you do will prevent yourself from gulping one down (from the law of noncontradiction);
If you will not drink a root beer tomorrow, than all attempts to drink one will be ineffective (from the law of noncontradiction again);
In either case of whether or not you will drink a root beer tomorrow, you do not have control (follows from 2 and 3);
Conclusion: You are thus not free to choose in this situation (from 1 and 4)."
Okay
"Haha okau"
"I'll give you an example again so you can formulate you answer again about the interesting universes."
"here's the fun problem. Logical fatalism"
now
gotcha
"Now in this sense, I'm not sure if the dragon would be a true reality in that plane or if the dragon would be a hallucination combined with delusion in our current reality. That's the conundrum."
"I believe that we do. We have the ability to choose how both perceive things and react to the things we percieve.  We can see or do whatever we want.  It may not make sense in the ""group"" reality levels, which is what I like to call the chunk of planes of existence in which the majority of observers exist.  You cam battle a flying dragon in another reality but because no one else is observing thay reality, you are the outlier and thus perceived as ""crazy"", but if another person allowed your beliefs to penetrate there's in a full way, you could both battle the dragon."
"Do we have free will?"
"so let's see..."
"And yes universal knowledge"
okay
neat
okay
OH
"Youve told me about this"
"like universal knowledge"
"There is like this higher plane of knowledge in play"
"He has this idea of ""forms"" and we know them from the time we are born. Particulars, or objects as he calls them just participate in the forms. Ex: Pam is pretty. She is participating in the form ""pretty."" This makes sense because we have always known what pretty is and she fits into it neatly"
"to digress for a moment"
nice
"That's VERY plato"
"I believe knowledge is inherently a part of everything because to be everything is to know everything, and all matter is connected.  When we ""learn"" something that has been previously known as true, we are simply remembering the way things are.  That's why when you learn an entire idea, you often think 'that makes sense', because it has always made sense, and you just came to remember that it makes sense."
"How do we come to know things?"
"Do we know everything at birth or do we know nothing?"
"So would you say Knowledge is top down or bottom up? does it come from knowing universals and at some point going ""AHA I RECOGNIZE THIS"" or is knowledge from observing and perceiving?"
"Where as a grain presented as a grain cannot be a heap, it has always been a single grain to the observer."
"It would then be a heap and a grain."
"But things are not always just one thing."
"If the sand or hay was originally presented in the form of a heap or a bail, it continues to be that because it was a part of the whole object identified as the heap or bail.  The identity of the grain remains associated with its past form because the identity was set on when you called it a heap."
"Is a single straw of hay still a bail?"
"What do you say? is a single grain of sand still a heap of sand?"
"You have a heap of sand, from which grains are individually removed. Under the assumption that removing a single grain does not turn a heap into a non-heap, the paradox is to consider what happens when the process is repeated enough times: is a single remaining grain still a heap?"
"okay so here's a problem"
"And the multiverses constantly shifting"
"That car one was great haha"
Yesss
"i just opened a doc called ""hunters idas"""
"But it's important to read it. It's validating to know someone has thrown your ideas out in a cohesive way, and like thinking about what you don't like and how you'd say it differently"

Only one. One will happen. I will or won't kill someone. Therefore, there is nothing I can do to change that outcome. One is definitely going to happen. Fate is fixed. Life is determined."

"But if its gone tomorrow"
"It sounds like it could be something"

"I already did reading."
"But in this case it may be useful"
"I would"
"Yea somewhat. I mostly try to leave them alone."
"Or other websites"
"But have you tried web md"
"I hate this cop-out"
"Fuck I hate this so fucking much"
"It could be something"
"It could be nothing"
"That's tricky"
"Wait until later this evening and see if its improved?"
"I don't know what to do."
"But I do feel really warm, but that could be from so much stress"
"Okay thats definitely an explanation"
"But I may or may not be anally bleeding, its hard to tell because I had a colposcopy yesterday and am bleeding from that generally area, and I'm bloated"
"Okay I'm trying to figure this out by myself"
"I think the problem is"
"I don't have diarrhea"
"The runs is one thing"

"That's serious...."
"HOLY GOD"
"GO TO THE DOCTOR. GET ELECTROLYTE PANELS"
"But I'm bleeding"
"Or what to do"
"And I don't know what doctor to go see"
"That's why I wanted to tell you, not to be angry or upset but so you understood what I was feeling and why"
"So i can improve"
"Well im aware now. Im just not a super self aware person so you need to tell me these things"
"I just wanted you to know how hurt I was by your actions so that maybe I could come to terms with my own mistakes. I understand alienating oneself."
"I realize that im the worst. I do. You dont have to tell me that. My life speaks for itself. I have no one else. I have alienated everyone"
"Im just not."
"Then you realize this is me making a selfish mistake and apologizing right? Because you know im not capable of beibg any closer to perfect than i am."
"I know you have no agenda."
"Im just self absorbed. And you aren't. Obviously"
"But dont over analyze my intentions. Because frankly, i have no agenda. Not alterior motives"
"If you want to be angry with me, you have every right"
"I just lose sight of things when my own issues overarch everything else"
"I never meant to take you for granted"
"I dont put in effort in any area of my life anymore. At least in the parts that matter"
"Im not a super caring person. But i try."
"I can undo my actions. I can only take responsibility for them"
"I am sorry that i was inattentive"
"I am sorry that you got sick"
"I didnt know it was that big of a deal or i would have been more comforring5"
"I had to sit in a parking lot drinking water so I could keep puking"
"I told you that I had to pull over two separate times to vomit on the road"
"I had no idea you were ill. I just thought you were irritated so i left you alone"
"You can make me to be crazy if you want to.  I don't care."
"The WHY of a situation does not matter. Forget about all of that.  Regardless of the food, I was violently ill and you didn't say a damned thing to make sure I was okay or made it home."
"I realize this"
"Dont make thjs something more than it is. Ive been self involved recently and ive had stupid shit distracting me from whats important"
"Shell obviously pay you"
"You can have your mom give me either the money for the gecko or the gecko.  You're right, I didn't have to do any of that, but I did it because I wanted to make you comfortable."
"Fuck off."
"Shut up."
"Then act like you were forced"
"You do things for people"
"What is with this victim complex?"
"I apologize for coming off that way. It was not my intent. But you didnt have to take me. You didnt have to eat the food. You didnt have to go to kroger. You are being so childish. I obviously  care about your health and comfort. Youve just fabricated a world in which you mean nothing to me so as to feel like a victim. Why? You know i would never intentionally hurt you. You KNOW this"
"Then I'll go ahead and let you know what's up.  Your mom allotted me 100 dollars to take you back to school, which was sort of a hike.  You didn't let me have any of the money except for exact gas money, you spent the night before and that day talking about how much your life sucks because of Isaac, you then wanted me to get Isaac from the airport, you decided I couldn't go to whole foods because it wasn't what you wanted to do, and then criticized my food purchases, I basically cleaned your apartment, and then you didn't want to bother allowing me to eat something that wouldn't make me sick, which you were going to pay for with the money your mom gave me to take you to Columbus, and then you decided you weren't paying for the food I didn't want to buy in the first place, and I spent the ride home WRECKED sick, and you didn't even make sure I got home alright.  You expressed no concern for me whatsoever and only give a shit if Isaac is going to leave you or not on a day to day basis.  I'm bleeding from that food, and I can't believe you just care so fucking little about my health or my comfort. I don't care if you choose to see what I'm saying.  I'm done with it, because I can't keep letting other people hurt me."
"I just need to hear what you have to say"
"Yes. Im in chem lab and im trying to have a conversation in two minute intervals so im kinda stressed."
"Fuck it dude."
"You haven't even let me say what I wanted to and you're already being defensive?"
"I dont understand why im under scrutiny here."
"Well, I never said anything about that, but thanks for the input."
"No one made you do anything"
Ok?
"I mean if you want me to be totally honest I'll go down the list of things I took note of."
"In all seriousness...WHAT...?"
"What are you talking about?"
"I'm sort of upset by the way things went Sunday. I feel like I was taken advantage of."
"Probably not much longer"
"And I'm wondering how long I should wait before getting it checked out"
"Ever since the other day I have been having some seemingly serious but probably not bowel problems"
Yep
"Hey, you up?"
"Night bud"
Goodnight
"Ill attempt"
"I'm gonna sleep. Promise me will get a few hours."
"No you're not, you're choosing to be"

"he sounds ridiculous but i always find myself smiling"
"i sit so close to him now that i get to hear him laugh all day, we work the same shift and same days"
"i remember i was eating with him once, and im a messy eater obviously, and he just started laughing and watching me and finally said ""youre fucking adorable"".  he wants love.  he is just afraid of being hurt again."
"we have a dynamic, he treats me like his daughter that he is rying to show the correct way to go about things, and i try my best to listen because he is almost always right.  i want him to talk to me that way.  that's how we work best together.  he pretends that he doesnt need love and doesnt need emotion, so when he least expects it i give him something a little heartfelt and it makes him truly happy."
"Okay class time message me and ill reply later"
"But a little critical"
"Like its not the worst thing"
"He is trying to sound like this god of reason and i find it a little condescending with respect to you"
"he is just trying to self preserve, because that's the only way he knows to be safe"
"if anything, when i was pregnant, chris could not deal with it and josh could"
"i dont think that's really what it is"
"Hes just unequipped to deal with high levels of emotions. Not his fault. But what hes saying isnt true of everyone. Its josh who has the issue. Not a big issue. But hes addressing it in some way. Hes emotionally unavailable"
"the less close we were"
"and the crazier my situation got"
"because we were VERY close when i moved to VA"
"and then ""when you make decisions that increase your instability or increase the amount of chaos in your life, i have to remove myself from that situation.
i will not allow that to infect my life.
but that doesnt mean i don't care."""
"I catch his drift. A little wordy but message recieved."
"this is all him, btw"
Okay
"let's say that what we did was go bowling.
and all the time we go to bowl a game.
every week, a few times a week, etc.
then one day one of us is in a relationship
practically speaking, there is just not the same time to bowl as there used to be.
it's nothing to feel bad over
unless the relationship was what you really always wanted.
it's not because i suddenly don't like bowling in general, or i thought you were not good to bowl with. it's just that i only have so much time and if you're dating someone most of that ends up going to them.
as it is, if i were to start spending some of that with you, doing anything at all, it would probably mean less time that i'm spending with amber.
which isnt to say i wouldnt do it.
but just that it's not like i'm just setting on my ass with nothing to do the rest of the time.
i stay booked up."
"i have to show you this analogy h gave me earlier, after he mentioned how communicatoni is so important and i wanted to be clear about whee i stand"
"Thats a nice comparison"
Hahaha
"he is the creepy father figure i never had that i want in my life forever so he can tell me to be smart"
"he says its not my fault"
"he doesnt get angry at me anymore when people find out ""stuff"" about us"
"and i am making real head-way with josh as far as comfort goes"
"josh says that i win because chris gets to be the jealous ex now"
"i wanted him to die"
"YEA WITH YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR CAR AND YOUR DEGREE, RIGHT?"
"so i said"
"he is.  he was like IM DOING BETTER THAN EVER SINCE YOURE OUT OF MY LIFE"
"he's just pitiful"
"i told him i hope he gets fired nd he's a monster"
"and i WENT OFF on chris"
"im in love with josh and always have been. it makes me happy just to know he cares about my well-being and would risk his reputation tog ive me the time of day."
"he needs to *stop*"
"why is he still a thing"
"i forget he exists"
something
"chris is"
"and that made me really happy"
"even after chris is spreading shit about us"
"and i convinced josh to drive down with me"
"i have to go get my things from jacob because he's beign a whiney bitch"
"sometimes it's just the little things"
"awesome sauce"
"all it took was some gratitude, a little talking with josh, and a friend to give me 9 dollars for gas"
"im happy again"
"and this way i can slowly build geckos back up"
awesome!
"ive realized that when im with my ""tribe"", i feel loved and protected"
"im going to start a savings account for clothes, car stuff, and show costs"
"how so?"
"i think i finally found peace"
"and then he just mentioned being a libra"
"also, theres an amazing guy who sits beside me in fraud and he is HILARIOUS and loves good music and is super witty and has such a wird sense of humor, and i was like, i bet he's a libra"
"it's nice that he isnt freaking out anymore"
"and josh agreed, meaning that he has accepted that martin knows what's going down"
"and he just sort of cuddled me the whole time and talked about me and josh and how we should all go do something"
"because we were on molly, weed, wine, a little H"
"i thought he was going to try something"
"it was kind of weird"
but
"he's probably asleep, like i should be"
"Thats weird"
"havent even heard from martin and he spent the whole night cuddlign me, i just kind of laid there"
"and no one will talk to me"
"2:30 PM"
"i should be in bed"
"im dying right now"
"to 2:30 am"
"i went from working at 9 am"
"dude i swear"
"this morning i was like, fuck it, i want it so im gonna ask.  and i asked.  and he was like, okay."
:DDDDD
"TO GO WITH ME"
"HE IS ACTUALLY GOING TO REQUEST A DAY OFF"
"also JOSH IS GOING TO GO TO VB WITH ME TO GET MY STUFF FROM JACOBS AND THEN ENJOY OURSELVES"
"oh, i forgot, the worst meal of my life at waffle house"
"he had never bought me ANYTHING"
"i bought 50 dollars of shisha dude"
"and im like....who was footing the bill for those plans, dick?"
"I WAS SO EXCITED I HAD SO MANY PLANS"
"and he was like NO WE SHOULD WORK EVERYTHING OUT NOW"
"but he freaked out"
"what am i, a man>?"
"because, lets face it, im not going to pay for that entire trip myself"
"and when i said i didnt want to drive down in the snow for valentines day"
"i have done SO MUCH to him"
like
"dude he is obsessed with me"
Classing
"Sry not responding much"
"Thatz fair i think"
"i just cant"
"i told jacob today that we need to maybe back off of this thing and see how things play out for us because i cant deal with him anymore"
"and ill be good"
"i can just have coffee with josh"
"i dont have to have sex with anyone anymore"
"and this means"

"Because to be honest"
"Well I hope I'm clean"

"So. So am I."
Optimistic

"So fucking much"
"I hate her so much"
"I think I'm being reasonable"
"23 faggot. Now mind your own business and continue to talk your shit with her leave me out

"i told her ""you have to stop"""
"She won't stop"

"but we both know it's not"
"Then write something nice and professional and tell her to leave me alone"
"everything is right"
"in her pathetic little world"
"let her think it"
"She thinks my relationship with Jacob failed and that makes me angriest"
"to HER especially"
"you don't need to prove ANYTHING"
"you're better than asking me to do this"
"I can't even fend for myself because she blocked me"
"and it's stooping to her level"
"it's foolish"
"for good reason"
"No one else will do this"
"Come on michael..."
haha
"and couldn't"
"I jsut tried to be"
"but I'm not a confrontational person"
"that's yucky"
"That level of nastiness. Make it make you angry. And then start writing."
""

"Want me to show you what she said to me?"

"Okay wow"
"I need this to make her cry."
"And sprinkle in your best. Please."
"Something about how she has no future, has had a million abortions. Shayn broke her jaw hitting her in the face fucking her. Jacob loves me no matter what I do. As do you. I'm one of the most golden hearted people you've met and she is a junkie addict liar. I told her I thought she was fucking Spencer and she freaked out on me. She stole my pills from me. She made me move to Virginia and give up my house and my animals and now I have nothing and she thinks I'm the cunt"
"BRING IT"
"I have smoked like half a pack today, I've had no food, and I'm cranky as FUCK"

"Its not like you'll ever see her again."
"You should be that person."
"that's fucking ridiculous"
"why not?"
"I'd appreciate if someone would take my side with her but not a one will"
"I want her to burn in hell"
"Yea I'm just so sensitive to these things"
"but still"
"it still sucks"
"and you know it"
"that's NON SENSE"
"don't let that get to you"

"What are you gonna say to him abkut thjz?"
So
Sk
"Fb was closed out"

"they are 875 a month"
"so he has been getting info on the 2 bedroom townhouses across the street"

"and she got pissed off that we bought the mop"
"and we bought a 20 dollar swiffer type thing at walmart to help with the 4 dogs and 2 cats pissing on the floors"
"but she refuses to help me with gas or rent for it"
"but ive been letting them use my car to take hi in the mornings"

"that are like the one good thing from subway"
"subway does these chopped salds"
"currently eating the biggest salad of my life"
word
"But yes cuddling is the bomb"
"I loooove cuddling. I mean I cuddled with Shayn like a year ago and Chris acted like I had sex with him lol"
"I basically love to cuddle"
Hahaha
"And if you're sober"
"Well depends on how well you know someone"
"Is it weird that we are so into cuddling? It seems like everyone else just wants to fuck and leave hahaha"
"I mean day to day"
Haha
"Long term stuff is irrelevant if you know what you want BASICALLY"
"I can worry about med school later"
"I JUST WANT SEX AND ALCOHOL AND CUDDLING AND NETFLIX"
Is
"Everything until then I whatever"
"I am going to rule the world with lizards"
"Right?! That's me! Hahaha"
"My long term goals are already worked out. I'm all about short term right now hahaha"
"That's a good short term life goal haha"
"And unlimited breadsticks"
"That's all I want in life atm"
"I just want a pretty guy with a tan"
"Because you have reminded me with that last sentiment"
"I've said this once and I'll say it again"
"Plus, I think we looked damned good together. Hahaha"
"He told me if I wanted him to he would ""take me out"" in VA beach, he would be the perfect person to go out with. He won't be embarrassingly talkative like Chris or slutty like Kendall, he is reserved and we can be wall flowers together haha"
"No one else sees that of him so it makes sense why everyone thinks its so weird and wrong but really he is so similar to me and he just compliments every aspect of my personality. I think he will be my friend for a very long time. Even if something happens that goes awry, he values me to an extent that is pretty awesome"
"that makes sense"
yeah
wow
"That is him as well."
"You know how I am obsessed about not being crass and just keeping it unawkward and clean and classy at all times?"
"Yea he is really not a disgusting dog of a man like most seem to be haha"
"good for you"
"I just don't"
haha
"I wish  I had that patience/consideration"
wow
"Well I was just going to say, he is super respectful sexually and we always use condoms of course, always, and he is sort of....drawing me out of my shell slowly? He isn't forcing anything on me but at the same time he pushes the envelope just enough to allow me to slowly become more comfortable with what goes on in my head"
"DONT DO THAT TO ME OR I WILL TWERK"
"no tell me"
lol
"so I getcha"
"eh never mind lol"
"It took me a while to realize that I can't go to a hell that I don't believe in"
"I know"
"And dude like no one probably thinks this but"
"No diseases hahaha"
"I know you can tell me that again and again but I have to actually deal with it which requires a lot more than hearing what is okay"
hahaha
"except intentionally spreading disease"
again
"nothing about sex is wrong"
"nahhhh it's not wrong"
"Dealing with that is hard because I was taught it is so wrong"
"yes it does"
"Yea I mean, I'm dealing with a lot right now. I have discovered I definitely have a thing for some girls in a very domineering way, I could never date or love one but I could probably abuse one, if that makes sense"
"but you still know what youre doing"
"after a while"
"that you stop thinking aobut so hard"
"I really am really awkward and it kills me"
"It's one of those things liek swimming"
"you'd think I would be"
"I'm surprisingly not awkward about sex"
haha
"I was until I was like 13 and we left the church"
"I'm still getting over that so I can be who I am"
": /"
"And gross"
"My whole life I was taught that sex makes you immoral"
"My mom repressed me so hard dude"
Haha
Still
Turn*
"I need help with my self image during sex basically. I turned into an embarrassed little kid sometimes. I don't like that."
"they are the same issues with different manifestations"
"weird, yet key, differences"
"We have these"
"Why did our repressions come out at the same time? Hahaha"
lol
"I didn't even want help"
like
"that I just dealt with myself"
"because I had weird sexual issues for so long"
"it's just funny"
"I'm glad he is"
"that's wonderful"
"He is actually helping me a lot"
"He has already dealt with what I am going through"
"My sexual issues have hurt me for a long time"
"He's helping me so much Michael"
"Although, josh isn't abusive"
Hahahaha
"I'm assuming that's how it goes"
"I have never read it but"
"OH DEAR"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"Sure it is. Last night I started wondering if I'm living out 50 shades of grey"
haha]
"it's a BIT taboo"
"you have to understand"
"it's just"
"I get what you mean"
"Its really weird but I have to say the age difference is almost not there for me"
"Exactly. And I pretend like I find that weird too for everyone else's sake. But in reality I enjoy him immensely and he never bothers me."
"yeah because I have to imagine you and josh and then i instantly get cooties"
"Like, I shelter you from most of that shit anyways hahaha"
"Right, I can talk to you about weird sex stuff and you will talk about it but you're not on the same wavelength as me about it haha"
"I can't get that ouf of my relationship with him."
"so as an example"
"he wouldn't be that supportive"
"but he's so self absorbed"
"he would get it"
"if I was to talk with kelley about something serious or emotional"
"for example"
"see like"
HAHA
Hahahaha
"I have josh for sexual deviancy and blonde/white/chubby support group"
"I have you for the same things you have me for lol"
"I guess so"
HAHA
"She filled Trevor's spot"
"I have amber for geckos and weed"
"Yes, its like you're speaking my words for me hahaha"
"but still"
haha
"No one person encompasses all of these. Obviously, your roles kind of trump the others"
"I get different things out of different friendships. With you I nostalgia, humor, music, and the ability to talk about serious adult things. With anthony I get someone I can talk to about science. With Joy I get nostalgia and someone I can be obsessive compulsive with and talk to about gross sex things. With Kelley I get someone who I can yell about politics with."
"And no others"
"I have like 4 great friends"
"That's how I am exactly"
Yea
"That's how I am too. But I also find some of my friends attractive hahaha"
hahaha
"that's why I don't consider myself as someone iwth a lot of friends"
"I don't just become surface level friends"
"If I become friends with someone"
"That's how I am with friends though"
exactly
"If it were broken it would be devastating"
"Exactly. Everyone else can come and go but we have a serious connection as friends and nothing can break that"
"if that makes sense"
"like I could be without them"
"IDC if they live or die"
but
Friends
whatever
"is just"
"everyone else"
"the thing is"
"2 or 3 friends, who I basically treat the same as you but you're obviously number one."
"We are dependent on each other"
"But we have a relationship"
"You orjbably have not thought about this"
"I have like"
See?
Yikes
"Oh god me too"
"I need it, or I crumble. I mean, you definitely fit into that category for me. If I lost you as a support system and friend I would crumble."
"I realize I never needed it like I thought I did"
"Now that I'm not with bella"
"But like I don't need it"
"I want that"
"Because I project my own needs onto others"
"You obviously don't have that need for partnership that I have. I need to always feel like I have a team or a partner."
Hahaha
"My opinion will always be biased"
But
"I am a good listener"
"I getcha. I'm very much self sufficient. So I can't super relate. I love people,  but I don't love closeness."
"Because no one is"
"I just need ONE person to be supportive :("
"Plus, I would never tell my family about that hahaha"
"I know I can't really explain it but I just feel a really strong connection to him and that doesn't mean we have to date or whatever"
"Well that's cool"
"As far as gender goes"
"Josh has totally understood and he is actually basically the exact same as me"
Mhm
"Since I have discovered my gender identity or non identity rather"
hahahaha
Hahahahahahhaa
"Me too"
"Which ALWAYS HAPPENS"
"I'm sick of being the dude in the relationship"
"I had to make Chris my bitch to move here dude"
"I'm tired of always being in charge"
"Its like we are actually equals"
"Exactly. You see, this is a perfect balance. I feel perfectly balanced with him"
"You know"
"I think I need a break from that role"
"I don't like being in charge, but I also do"
"Well cool beans then"
"I could never feel more valued in any other situation. Seriously. I know he is 'the Dom' but in reality, I am totally in charge and it makes me feel fucking awesome"
"*dies in blood and fire*"
"*lives life by what michael says*"
"HE DOES"
HAHA
"He sees me as jewels and gold"
"I always don't like the fact that he's such a fedora. I could almsot put up with chris if he wasn't so emotionally screwed up. His personality isn't awful"
"He is almost 40, I am 20"
Also
"I'm drawn to that haha"
"He's not a pussy like Chris is"
"And I feel safe with him"
"He is a total gentleman"
"well that's good enoug ha reason"
"I just want to have him around because he makes me feel good and is nice to me"
"I know! I don't want to do that either!"
"but if that isn't what you're doing"
"I don't want you diving into one serious thing after another"
maybe
"I think"
"he could be your equal best friend to me if you wanted"
"Well then help me understand haha"
hell
"I'm not insecure"
lol
"that's not it"
no
Oh
"Sort of"
"That's how I see it at least"
"He is like my 2nd best friend and because he is not so much romantically inclined, he almost seems like he is stepping into your ""best friend territory"", because obviously "" there is only room for one best friend, and one boy friend, they cannot be both"""
hahaha
"well let's hash this out"
"But I could be wrong"
"I think I may understand why"
"AND I CANT FIGURE OUT WHY"
"NOT AT ALL"
"I DONT"
"I know you dude lol. You don't want me to become an item with this guy. You don't like it."
damn
haha
"that was my doubt about this"
"that is my assumption"
"you're right about the first part"
but
"to the last part"
ehh
Hahaha
"And you have to remember that Chris is older than him physically"
"You don't like the josh thing because you are assuming that it has to go the way it always does, that I will have to move in with him or something, that I will have to be committed to this ""weird old guy"". In reality, he would never make me do any of that shit for him, and if he did want that type of thing, it would be to my discretion"
"I want more than that for myself. I am more needy. I project this obviously lol"
"Well yeah for you"
"Isn't that what you want?"
"He is SO good to me"
"I mean, really, think about it"
"I suppose so."
"I know I obviously have rose tinted glasses on but at the same time, there still has been no further verbal commitment and I really really like him. I know you think he is annoying but that's really the only negative thing about him as a person"
"Unbiased he sounds great. But that's not the whole story haha. He rubs me SO FAR THE WRONG WAY. But I can be unbiased and acknowledge that he makes you happy. You just cant. Relationships aren't objective like that haha"
"You have to look at it in an unbiased manner. For me"
"Well, he is a nice person and he is protective over me and wants to maintain a good friendship. I really enjoy it because honestly I feel closer to him now than I ever did to Chris, because Chris is not an adult. Josh has his shit together. He has a nice car, a great stable job, SAVINGS haha"
"But I guess it is and I shouod accept it"
"I just didn't know it was going somewhere"
"I am happy that you're happy but I truly dislike thay guy."
"No one cares"
"No one is happy for me"
"No one likes him"
"Yes :/"
"Am I a bad friend currently hahaha"
UGH
"I'm sorry. I just thought what you had with him was just a fling. He's old and weird."
Ew
"Yea he said he needs to start really getting his shit together to leave"
"And she's coming too of course lol"
"Hahahahahahahaha what"
"He's definitely going to come here now"
"Josh was forced to demote amber"
"Make a friend!"
"Message someone who you don't want to fuck!"
"I said join a FB group!"
"Look, you are doing a bad job at making friends"
"I told him"
HAHAHAHA
"he has no confidence obviously or he would not be on ok cupid"
lol
"even chris's posture like reeks of self loathing."
"usually older adults"
"for people who don't know how to interact with people in real life"
hahaha
"ok cupid"
WHORE
"that's not a friend, that's a white"
"He told me this morning this one girl lost her virginity at 26, and he has been talking to her for TWO DAYS"
"I feel like he's recruiting an army of lookalikes that I don't like"
"Yes!!!! Dude I'm so annoyed with Chris. He is talking to all these girls that look like me on okcupid and for some reason he thinks I'm okay with him telling me about these girls, but if I mention the person I like he just loses interest immediately"
YAY
OMG
"Dude we might be able to afford internet since my dad helped out with the car :D"
SERIOUSLYT
"I agree. Some are like...traumatizing"
"dude some nipples are just so disgusting"
"I AM WHAT I AM"

"so I'm watching the series finale of 30 rock"
"THATS WHAT IM SAYING"
HAHAHA
"HAHAHA to prove my point I just got a ""I am quite fond of you"". Why does he have to talk like Morrissey hahaha"
"He is wishy washy"
"He just told me that he ""loves"" when he has been with me, and wouldn't change a thing about me physically"
"He is deluding himself"
Lol
"That has nothing to do with long term"
"He is not having sex with me all of the time"
"He said that means"
"Hisbwording is just wrong"
waat
lolol
"I'm asking what the hell that even means"
"""But you are not a longterm project. Sadly."""
"And then"
"Maybe he is not enough for me"
"Okay he just said"
"I don't know, I'm trying to figure it out."
what?
"emotionally? phsycially?"
Hahahaha
"Is what he meant"
"""You are a long term project and I will break you"""
TRANSLATE
"he needs to not talk like he's writing the libbretto of an opera"
"Let me translatebhahaha"
"I prefer very blunt language"
"No no let me translate"
hahahaha
"strained poet"
a
"why does he sound like"
"the way that's worded"
"I HATE"
Jesus
Hahahahaha
"""I'd make it my business to break you"""
HAHAHA
"Josh just said.... ""If you were a long term project for me"".... I am interested to see what the hell he could follow that with hahaha"
"to cure yourself of the issue"
"it probably would take one isntance"
however
"that's on you"
see
"How do I not do that?"
"that's the issue"
"yeh I figured"
Everything
"I think about like"
"Yes. All of the time."
"I bet you think a lot about things that aren't in the immediate moment"
"Well, I can, but you know. Not with other people generally."
"I can have sex but I cannot orgasm"
"No no"
"I have no problem there"
"Just, sex"
hahahaha
"then what are we talking about"
"Like, behind closed doors of course"
"I am totally comfortable with sex"
"No but I'm saying"
"alcohol helps you get comfotablr with that stuff"
"I would never be able to orgasm drunk haha. I am basically sexually stunted in the first place."
"but alcohol gets rid of those inhibitions"
"but it makes sense here"
"I know that sounds like a BAD decision"
"you need to fuck someone drunk, get comfortable with it, and then do it sober"
"I think"
"I don't know if I, like, would be comfortable with a person seeing me orgasm. That feels like the weakest thing a person could do. If I don't do it, I have the upper hand. I know that makes no sense."
"Hahahaha you've got this"
hahahahaha
"and I can't figure out what it is"
"but I'm trying to say somthing"
"Hm. I have never seen him as obviously inferior to me"
"so my wording is off"
"I think I may still be drunk a bit"
"You could obviously have done better than chris. The fact that you were clearly the superior in the relationship put you in a situation to where you were comfortable. You didn't have to think about anything as far as the relationship. It was frustrating, but it wasn't interesting. it was ""comfortable"""
"Explain that"
Hahahahaha
"that's why you choose companions that you're obviously better than. Not like even a little, like obviously. You like being in a ""comfort zone"""
"I know"
"I don't know I'm just not a comfortable person"
Yea
"I don't like people in their 20s though. Well, a few haha"
"get comfotable with people."
"Just let go of inhibitions."
"people in their 20s."
"just put yourself out there."
"in your new life."
"like new fiends"
"you need to form a solid group of friends"
"I can with Chris"
"This makes sense because"
Hm.
"and then you become comfortable with it"
"just once"
"live without premonition"
"You just have to do it once to turn it off"
"it's KIND of true"
"I do D: I can't turn off the brain"
"but in this instance"
"which is a nonsense saying kind of"
"you think too much"
"liek everything else"
"It really does."
"you probably over think it"
"that must suck"
"But it kind of sucks to be too uncomfortable with sex to orgasm"
"but go on"
"it's probably not gross"
"This may be gross or I may just be a prude"
do
"jsut say"
"don't over think it"
"I'm trying to. I keep telling myself what you're saying. That its natural and just a part of being human."
"talk it out with him"
"don't over think it"
"no no no"
"sex is just part of the human experience"
"I hate myself haha"
"because guys do the same thing without a label"
"I mentioned it to josh, he's just like, you get really embarrassed"
"the word whore, slut, ect, don't even really exist"
like
haha
"and you jsut need to occasionally remind yourself that it's ok"
"it's not"
"It's just"
"I know"
"My mom always made it seem that way"
"I was raised that it was"
"I know"
"Yea aids is not so great lol"
"but you need to purge yourself of this idea that sex is shameful"
"that's ethically...a grey area as far as sex is concerned"
"unless well, you purposefully give someone aids via sex"
"Ethically, it's no different than any other human interaction"
"that is a false concept"
"not even in the middle ages"
"Sex is not involved in the concept of respect"
"so here is what I need to correct with you. Or at least point out"
"And that last thing"
OK
Yes
"And sex is not respectable"
"like putting yourself out there with something so sensitive?"
"I want to be a respected person"
Compromising
"It seems"
Ummm
"what makes you the most uncomfortable about sex?"
HAHA
haha
"just demonstrates how uncomfrotable you are"
"the fact that you said ""racy"""
"At some point he's just like ""OK"""
omg
But
"Josh decided to talk about ""racy"" stuff and I'm always pretty straight forward and non sexual about it hahaha"
"lets hur it"
"Okay so like"
hahahahahaa
"me too."

"Our friendship behavior is what is similar"
"That's true"
"Quite a bit"

"Define us"
"You are. HAHAHA"
"But the ones that exist"
"There are so few differences between us"
"That's another thing we differ on. I am like a hypersexual 15 year old"
Lol
"Because that's a large part of me as a person in a sexual relationship"
"And I am a prude so obviously he likes it"
"Well I think he likes it because he has made a point to say I seem super innocent"
"I assume he isn't then?"

"I have in the past been a prude"

"Yea that does sound odd. That's how I felt whenever I lived with Gary."
"hahaha. It is a WEIRD feeling"
"temporary* anyway"
"I am in this weird intermittent feeling of homelessness. I have a place I'm not living at right now, but it's only temporarily"
"I'm glad"

#impressiveblessing
"I think he just hoards his money"
"Well he told me once that when he gets tax returns, he puts it in the bank and doesn't touch it"
"can he afford to help? I mean my understanding as of late was that he's pretty poor himself"
wow
"That was surprising"
So
"Also I told him that we're not doing great on money, he said he has not offered because he wants me to succeed on my own but to let him know if I can't afford food"
nonetheless
"but helpful"
"that's weird"
"He is helping me with everything, he asks me to send him my location and then he tells me how to get where I need to go haha"

"We got up at 6, packed and loaded until 10, were an hour behind schedule to get the keys before the office closed so I somehow made it here only 4 minutes late and we got them. And my dad drove down with the trailer too. We filled his van and my car and a 5x10 trailer and still couldn't bring everything. We left a shit ton of stuff. But I'm still happy."

"Today was a journey I didn't think I could handle lol"

"I need to drive I think"
"That's fine"
"We can go somewhere soon. Okay."
"Let me get myself together a bit more"
"Just come inside."
"Do you want to go somewhere? I'm outside"
"On my way be there in like 10"
"I just left but I'll be back in like 3 minutes lol"
"What is wrong with me"
"I hate myself"
"I know"
"you get emotionally like, sacrficial"
"This makes me want to just settle with Chris because he cares and I feel like no one else ever will"
Anymore
"I am realizing that I can't be in relationships anyone"
Seriously
"It makes me want to die"
"I hate it so much"
"I know"
"that is true"
"you get really attached"
"slow down slow down"
"I can't even keep up dude"
"Once you're that deep into a persons life, getting out is painful"
"Its so hard for me to like a person though. I fall in love with personalities."
"This is the feeling that makes me want drugs"
"And feel like this again"
"I'm so terrified to even look at a new person for the fact that I may become attracted to them"
"Because of this"
"Michael I'm so afraid to like anyone"
"Its not like I'm mean to everyone"
"I just don't understand how so few people care that I'm leaving"
"I sort of believe it"
"I don't know"
"I believe it but I'm still crying some"
"you ahve to believe it"
"I can't sit here and tell you this though"
"dude you're not"
"Like I don't even exist"
"I just feel so insignificant to everyone else"
"I'm sorry : ("
"god damn"
"He just left"
"But my boss didn't even say good bye to me today"
"I get to see you which I'm happy about"
"And I'm getting blown off by josh"
"He is going to a bar with his girlfriend and a bunch of his friends"
"Its so upsetting that everyone loves Chris"
"Dude like"
"I just am gonna be doing some minor stuff."
Yes
"Are you okay to hang out?"
Okay.
"I have to leave the house soon"
"What a dick :/"
"I just want to be in morgantown. I am so alone in Columbus. So alone. My one friend there ignored me today."
"Well you can always talk to me if you get lonely"
"I may try and work or something but there weren't shifts last time I checked"
"I will be so alone in charleston. You're leaving.  But that's better than alone in a basically, strange city"
"Hahahaha you are the best"
Sooo
"But I'm like the little sebastian of friends"
"I have to drop Chris off with all of his friends while I have one friend and he is you"
"I can't be in Columbus alone for a week"
"Because I have changed plans."
No.
"Are you too busy packing to hang out for a bit?"
"I think I'm gonna come back home tomorrow."
"Always am. Don't even worry about it"
"Thank you so much for always being there for me when no one else is"
"I love you michael"
"I wish I knew what would make me feel better"
"I'm sorry I just have not loved anyone and lost at it in a long time"
"It seems like he wants me to get away from him because he cares about me"
"He is so encouraging"
"He keeps telling me that I will be fine. That I'm solid."
"Just honest"
"Which is sort of rude but not really"
"And he said, that's likely, I will have no one down there and he has friends here"
"I told him that I'm afraid I will miss him a bit more than he will miss me"
"He is just so honest with me that it hurts sometimes. I guess"
"I am all sad now THANKSSSSS"
"Hold on..."
"He sais"
"It's probably not"
"He said that he will likely come visit. I just hope that isn't a lie to appease me."
"And that's rough"
"You're just going to miss him"
"It sounds like he cares"
"I'm sorry if that's blunt"
"But he didn't cut you off you're just over reacting"
"I guess so. He gave me a hug before I left work, in the parking lot in front of a lot of people. He asked me to let him know that I get there safe. I want to be like him. I want to be able to cut people off."
"What you are doing is overly analytical. Be upset because you will miss him, not because of this weird isolated incident that means nothing"
"I am upset because there is an attraction. He does have feelings for me. He may move to where I live. But now he is tired and doesn't want to hang out."
"I am an interesting person. I am kind. I'm not bad looking. I care. But if there's not attraction there just isn't I guess"
"I am upset when I can't get what I want after I've rationalized it."
"I wish I could cry and drink with you"
"I guess I just get upset when I can't get what I want, especially when I have worked for it"
"Accept that you care, but also come to terms with the fact that it may be different from how they care, and that may not ruin your friendship but it will limit your relationship"
"Don't think of it like that"
"That's why I'm angry with myself. I care, and I don't want to."
"It's a challenge but you can't let messed up emotional connections ruin your life"
"If it makes you feel any better I cried for like two hours even though I knew exactly what kiefer was going to say to me. Trying to think ""maybe it would work if..."" 

The truth is sometimes things just don't go the way you plan and you have to cry it out and move on. Do not let a guy affect your happiness. Fight it."
"How he doesn't feel the same"
"But I don't understand"
"I'm sorry"
:(
"So it must be true"
"Reading that hurt my heart"
"Coming to terms with it"
"Or welp"
"Ans are just realizing it"
"You've always loved him anyway"
"Like I guessed"
Or
"A little"
"I let my guard down"
"How did this happen"
"No one is"
"But I guess I was wrong"
"I thought I was totally self assured"
"So much"
"I don't know but I hate it"
"Why do any of us care about anyone or anything that is seemingly useless?"
"The guy I was talking to to make myself feel good last night when i was drunk hasn't talked to me all day. Why do I care?"
"Why do I feel things"
"For caring"
"I'm angry at myself"
"I don't know if I'm pissed"
:(
"I am pissed too. My mom went to a fucking hair appointment instead of helping me"
"If I even see him again"
"I probably won't see him for another year"
"Why do I care"
Why
"I'm so upset"
"Its the josh thing"
No
"Tell him to come back"
"This is fucked"
"Help me, why am I crying"
"I mean what did you expect dude"
"Chris is useless"
"I'm doing everything"
"Working on it"
No
"Are you all packed?"
"And josh doesn't want to hang out"
"And I'm home alone"
"Chris is going out with a bunch of friends"
"Dude I'm so upset"
"but im getting more"
"i did"
"Oh you hadn't gotten them yet?"
"josh has made no effort to say good bye either"
"im about to leave as soon as i get these boxes from amber"
"im so sick, they made me eat a brownie and then barrett left without even saying good bye"

"but thats just me"
"i would not come back"
"I was gonna come back after I set my stuff up"

"I guess I'm gonna go to bed man"
"Yes that much I do know lol"
"very much so ithink"
"he is ompliated"
Sometimes
"He is smart"
"I can't tell"
"Like, its almost as if he is either very bipolar and borderline or this is an act to make me enjoy when he is nice more"
yes
Agreed?
"like consitancy"
"If he is calling me cute and adorable and shit, that shouldn't stop whenever I leave his company. That should continue during normal life."
"I get it"
"god I wan to cuddle something"
"do it"
"no i can"
"I just want him to treat me like he does when we spend time together, but all of the time"
"You're too drunk to be encouraging lolol"
"the friendship will likely last"
"it can be ruf"
"I kno"
"I want to be friends with him for a long time"
"I'm sorry dude I'm just upset about this right now because this guy is not just some dude, he is one of my closest friends"

"it seems confusing"
"try and figure it out"
"play it as you go"
"y it as hpla"
"he is being weird"
"those are mixed signals"
"I'm getting mixed signals"
"If he didn't care"
Me
"After Mr"
"Like, why would he move the VA"
"He is fostering some sort of emotional thing from me and I don't want to feel things for him but I know he feels them back but he is a dick sometimes. He is never trying to be mean though. He is just assertive and doesn't talk much I think."
"I don't know, he is doing this weird thing"
"Fuck okay"
"just let it all out at me"
"dude I t will not help if I do that"
"Tell me why he is still going to make room for me because he probably won't work THAT late"
"Analyze him to make me feel better or something"
"That's not a big deal though. What IS is JOSH because I am going to be decently upset if he blows me off. I'm not crying or anything because that would be bad but he's my friend too ya know."
"that's stupid"
"punish him with your hands"
"Because he wants me to feel guilt"
"why would this exchange happen"
"That's SO WEIRD"
Chris

"I'm trying to get real support here"
"let me know"
Hahahahaha
"I own a magnet that can scramble his pacemaker"
"Its so weird"
"But he would never type that to me"
"Because the other day he told me he wanted to at least see me at work before I left"
"I think he is but I've been wrong once before. Just once. Lol"
"Or not"
"I can't tell if he's bluffing"
"He should make time for me. I think."
But
"And work IS very busy"
"And tomorrow is the last chance I have to see him at all before I'm gone"
"I leave Friday morning"
why
"yeah continue"
"I am sad"
Anyways
"Ah okay"
"that is a quote from my watching of what I am now watching"

"Fuck it"
So
"Eh, I'm happy."

"oh wow"
"Its become painfully obvious at this point"
"Josh keeps trying to get me away from Chris, or establish that I'm absolutely not going back to him"

"OSU is a prestigious school. It's very good for what I'm doing. However, being a poor, out of state student who Transferred (they don't give transfer students any scholarships) I kind of knew I was digging a hole in the back of my head"
"I mean all things aside"

"so that tattoo chris got"
"youll be very glad you did"
"once you get it over with"
"it seems like ahuge thing to accomplish but"
"well, yea, that's the sensible thing to do in my opinion"
"and her first instinct was come back"
"I explained the situation"
"she would never come back"
"because she hates wv"
"what she thought"
"I just asked bella"
"I know"
"Well I think you associate ohio state with the glamourous lifestyle of a non-west virginian and for that reason it feels like it may be a mistake to even step foot back in this state.  that is super understandable.  but if the degree you want happens to be free here, and very costly over there..."
"should I keep fighting them?"
"Everything is saying go back"
"But it's like all of the signs are telling me not too"
afterwards
"and THRIVE"
"and survive"
"you will endure"
"you can do this"
"UM YEAH"
"Oh shit, this is your virginia."
"I'm not kidding"
to*
"This is maybe the hardest thing I've ever had ot face"
"I would say that's the smartest thing to do.  Plus, you will be able to get a cheaper apartment and save money there as well"
"But next semester I may have to leave"
"I have the money to pay a penalty if there is one"
"but you can move out if you want to"
"I don't know how exactly or what the consequences are, if any"
"You can break the lease"
"That is an issue"
"for a year"
"I signed a lease though"
"I think I might have to"
"I'm at such a loss"
"but dude"
"can you not transfer?"
HAHAHA

RETRIBUTION

"And i shut these hos down"
HAHA
"It's my last day"
"Today my exit from work was like mic dropping"
"yea it fucked me up for a minute"
"I'm sorry"
"Wow that's the literal worst"
"first time ive experienced something like that"
"and then i remembered that she killed herself last year"
"and i said, that looks like my friend katie, i wonder if she still works here"
"i saw a girl working on her car, in a tbell uniform"

"All skin is different though :/"
"It takes like a week"
"I did all of that D:"
"Listen to what I told you to do. Use benzylperoxide creams as needed but sparingly. Don't use face wash with that or salysilic acid. Use a cleanser like dove soap or cetaphil once per day. Wash your face with warm water in the morning and use a moisturizing facial lotion to reduce redness and inflammation."
"you know your skin's bad when your boss asks what facial cleanser you're using..."
"I know. Its normal to get hung up on someone, especially when they've been idealized for so long"
"I just can't let go of it"
"Yea I mean, I really don't like relating your situation to mine but I have experienced this same let down"
"I knew what was gonna happen. I just don't know why I'm so hurt that it didn't go ideally. I knew it wouldn't. I was perfectly prepared. I'm not used to being rejected and it feels awful."
"I can tell you, friendship is the best foundation to build on there.  Then, if anything extra does come about, it won't be weird, you'll be comfortable with him, and if it goes wrong he will still value you enough to be your friend through it"
"He's just always seen me as like a weird sometimes friend I think. Who's to say never...but I should definitely try to be friends with him"
"I'd like that"
"Go into it only expecting to be his friend"
"I still think you should foster a friendship with him if possible"
"I could sort of see that"
"I feel like knowing someone as a friend and like stand partner throughout your whole life basically kind of makes looking at someone as more than a friend...impossible anyway"
"That's understandable, it's been a few years of anticipation"
Sadly
"I am still sad"
"its the perfect time"
"this is a huge time for change"
"that's awesome dude"
"My mom is looking for jobs out of state"
"and he did"
"to find where he is happy, and look for employment there"

"Dude like"
Yikes....
"Which is like 15 minutes from Norfolk"
"Josh applied for a job in Hampton"
"Dude so"
"He was, and I'm really glad for that. I didn't want you to get torn up over it."
"I'm fine. I wasn't shocked. I'm just a little bummed. I feel better though. He was so nice about it"
"How are you doing man?"
"Almost there"
"Right out front"
"Okee dokee"
"passing through clendinin"
"How close are you to Charleston?"
"That's so awesome :D"
"and it was so weird"
"not my moms"
"that it's my address"
"and it hit me"
"and I gave them my address"
"Dude today the cable company called to confirm my set up"
"yeah you don't have to do that"
"I can't give it to her"
"Dude my mom just asked for my new address"
"Yesss okay"
"I'll be at the greyhound station in less than an hour. proabably about nine."
also
EXACTLY
HAHA
"He can't care that much"
"He already takes me out to eat in downtown Charleston"
"I suppose"
"I know lol obviously but I don't want to enrage him. Obviously as soon as I leave he will stop caring."
lol
"you can do whatever you want"
"He keeps making it weirder than it needs to be and literally everyone in the office has it figured out. But I'm not ""allowed"" to  acknowledge it."
"josh has mafe it a little weird"
haha
"that shouldn't be so weird dude"
"like the amber thing"
"navigating it this way"
"it is making it challenging for you"
"who cares"
"but if you are happy with what is happening"
"I mean it is."
"I mean...you don't think it is supremely weird and creepy? Because that's how I feel others would view it."
"but it isn't THAT big of a deal"
like
"I mean discretion   obviously"
"ITS STUPID"
"Because his department is separate from mine and we have no business being in each others departments. Also, he is the one who insists no one knows."
"is it just hotter for people to not know"
"why does this matter"
"I know she isn't retarded"
"So I'm going to have to go look amber in the face and ask her for moving boxes"
"And he goes, amber will have some tomorrow, I just checked with her. Ask her tomorrow for boxes."
?
"I was like, I don't know where to get boxes to pack in"
"Dude he set me up"
"I mean, I can't talk to him at work like I would away from work. Im not switching?"
"stop switching"
"then think of it in one way"
"we have nothing to talk about at work"
"if you think of us in ""friend"" terms"
"it's just awkward"
"well yea i mean"
HAHAHAHAHAH
"UCK YOU"
"what does this tell you"
"I am not that awkward. unless it comes to someone I have feelings for"
"I don't get how he thinks that is possible"
"Like, how am I even supposed to talk to him in front of people?"
"I am too awkward"
"I can't deal with myself at work"
"I heard the voice and looked back and saw the hair, and just went back inside"
yikes#
"run for the door"
"Gahh I was outside and Josh walked out with Amber and I had to like"
"Yea dude. Trust me. Baby that a bit."
haha
"well good then"
"I know how it feels. Honestly the part of you that isn't confident is great bait for dudes. A lot of them seem to like the shy, innocent, scaredish type lol"
"It's just hard to"
"I've been told like ten times in the past few days that I don't give myself enough credit"
"You've got this way more than you think you do"
"We have drive"
"If I don't give myself enough credit I definitely don't give enough to other people"
"that's true"
"You never know dude. I didn't think I would be where I am now."
"which I'd be okay with"
"I imagine he'd just wanna be friends and he'd appreciate me being up front with him"
"in the best case scenario"
"I dunno dude"
Hahahaha
"Well, I know how charming and witty we are and no one can resist it soooo"
"Just curious"
"What makes you think he won't ignore me?"
"Yes, best case you strike up a conversation"
"best case he replies right?"
"But I doubt he will"
"If he ignores it, you have done your part."
"Which is at the LEAST, what I ask"
yeah
"I have decided not to"
"Worst case scenario he ignores it"
"Don't let anyone else handle it"
"You have to handle this with precision"
"Give me a worst case scenario"
Yes
"No, tell him yourself"
"but to get closure I need  to do it myself"
"I halfway asked someone else to do it becaause I figured it wouldn't matter who it came from because he doesn't feel the same way"
"Yes, do it, the boldness is exciting me, RESULTS!"
"So it's not like it could get any more awkward"
"I'm not gonna see him"
"I'm not going to make a big deal out of it"
"Just a short and simple text. I'm gonna say I don't need a reply, I just need him to know."
"Tell me how."
"When I get home tonight."
"I am going to solve my problem today."
"and there would be essentially no consequences"
"If I were an asshole I could leave today and just not come back"
"im sorry"
yikes
"theyre taking it all because i used up my vacation days before i had technically earned the hours for them"
"im actually not getting to keep any of the money i make this week"
"i just want to sleep until friday"
"im so tired"
hahahaha
hahaha
"i saw it as german"
"that is so german"
"dude how is ""gotten"" even an english word"
"Gotten better but not gone"
"We both over think"
"BANG UP ADVICE, M8"
"Don't over analyze - just do"
"Because if I have to stop feeling feelings then this is going to take awhile lol"
"so let me make sure i understand.  people who do not live their life of others' accord, but rather do what they want...do they still feel these feelings?  and they just choose to act on the best idea?"
"Yea always"
"that is, isnt it?"
"i am fighting my feeling with logic because i think that's what im supposed to do"
"baleen hahahahaha"
"Or blame you"
"But I don't baleen yoi"
"Try not to"
"although, i cant say i wouldnt be a bit hurt if he hasnt started to care a bit more in some way for me?"
"which could explain josh not being very talkative"
"i think i saw cindy earlier"
"I don't care about the people who also do not care lol"
"That makes sense"
Yes
"i just wish the people that DO care were a little more evident in that fact?"
"You can replace them"
"They mean nothing if they don't care"
Sorry?
"i guess i dont really care but"
"i do but even so, none of them care"
"You have a small dept."
"no one cares"
"only 2 people in my department have even said something about me leaving"
"everyone in chris' department made him a huge card that they all wrote in, and apparently he lost his shit over it and was super sad"
Why
"im sort of sad"

HAHAHAHA
"My primus urges me to slap a bass"
Hahaha
"chris is not that"
"a healthy one with good genes"
"my primal urges tell me i need to be with a strong dude"
"plus, he is weak...."
"he doesnt have health insurance and hasnt really been to a doctor for a full check up in a very long time"
"yeah that's pretty bad"
"*squishing noise* 
*dog of man rises on his filthy haunches*
THANK YOU. VERY MUCH"
"because he has NEVER taken care of himself"
"dude like, chris has scholiosis and is balding and has bad teeth and stomach issues"

"a father"
"so basically"
"let me be free at the same time haha"
but
"he wants to essentially own me"
"yeah i see that"
"it would not be a stretch to think he finds solace in that"
"i mean...i honestly feel like he is sort of a person i can look up to for advice and he is very very similar to me"
"sometimes i assume"
"you are to him in a way"
technically
"i mean"
"but not quite creepy"
"its like, borderline creepy"
"and i dont mean that in a creepy way"
"but not always"
hahahaha
"he treats me like a little kid sometimes?"
"thats weird"

"he actually apologized to me so i guess i should have known better lololol"
"i think i tipped him over the edge"
"""i did like that thing but it's totally okay"", and i think he actually got upset because i was talking about how long i had them and what i did to get them to fit and how i love them so much, he felt terrible initially"

"He is a big baby"

"Haha yes, go!"
"Att won't have five dollar headphones"
"Fuck thay I ser an office depot"
"GO GO GO"
"I see ATT. across the road. Going for it"
"as you leave"
"his service is shit"
"and tell him"

"i bet you can find some headphones wthin walking distance"
"he was so mean about EVERYTHING"
HAHA
"WHAT AM I GUNNA DO"

lololol
"yea yea you sound like my mom"
"deyhdration cracks your skin, opens it up to infection, ect"
"your face NEEDS a certain amount of oil. It took me a bit  to get used to it, but some oil on your face is normal."
"too much acid"
"thats probably where im going wrong"
"yea i figured"
"It's just excessive use of product no matter how oily your face is CAN BE counterproductive"
"that is possible"
acne
"im waiting for salt water and beach sun to cure my ane"
"i dont normally though. i use like, shampoo or something"
"totally wash your face when you shower hahaha"
"I'm saying don't use acne fighting wash in the morning"
"When I so don't wash I'm not saying don't rinse your face off"
"i HAVE to wash in the morning. my oil is so bad that halfway through the day when i put sunglasses on, i have to clean my face oil off when i put them back in my purse"
"don't. I read in this dermatology thing that you should do it only at night. And it's true. It takes a couple of days, but there are natural oils that form on your face throughout the day that actually fight bacteria, and they need to stay there. Washing all of the grime off at the end of the day, and scarcely using the acid treatments works the best. It keeps your face from being overdryed and overirritated. It takes several days to improve, but it is so much better"
"and i manually remove blackheads with a special tool"
"i also use several acid type things"
"if not more than that"
"yes dude"
"do you wash your face in the morning and at night?"
"I'm sorry"
jesus
"my fluxtuates with hormones and the food i eat, so it could be fine one day, and make me want to die the next"
"yes, but not lately. I've figured out something that works for me and my face is so much better. haha"
"do you ever get to be that feeling of oily where you want to tear our your hair and dip your full face in bleach?"
"yeah that sounds godo"
"so it's totally doable"
"and rent would be about 600 a month"
"ill be making like 700-800 dollar pay checks"
complex
"i know.  im hoping that one day soon i will be able to just move into another house in the same complez."
"that's rough dude"
yikes
"As of now basically everything I do will be with Chris. we now will work the same hours and days and have one less room to live in haha"
disastrous
"because, well, that would be disasterous"
"like, i cant even have josh come down to visit while chris is with me"
exactly
"its away from him"
"I know"
"even if i live 2 minutes away from chris"
"to be honest i would feel better that way"
"i want to try to get my own place as soon as i can though"
"Sounds good 2 me"
haha
"i want to do a fulkl on pub crawl by the beach dude"
"I would love to."
"when we turn 21, you need to come party at the beach. i will know basically no one so i need you there if at all possible lol"
hahaha
"I'm looking at used cars in columbus...I could swing the payments. Just not the insurance."
"I mean I'll be 21 soon"

"he taught me about it"
"i bought the shampoo he uses"
"HAHA right"
"okay, thank you.  i swear, the fact that josh has all of his hair and takes care of it and uses products that i could benefit from is huge to me"
"I love my own hair and everyone elses"
"I like good hair"
haha
"I love hair"
no
"i feel bad for it"
"is that superficial?"
"its ruining my life that he is balding"

"that's just a funny combination of words"
"but not true"
"it's funny"
hahahahahahhaha
"I KNOW"
JESUS
HAHA
hahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"*philosophical objection*"
"also this morning he told me i only like josh because he is ""hot topic peter pan"", which is hilarious but uncalled for"
"also it would bother me because you're pretty body positive and i like that about you. I wouldn't want you to change"
"it would be"
"it feels really forced to me. like, if i were to all of a sudden go crazy about dieting.  that would be weird."
"I don't like it honestly. I get it, but I don't like it haha. I don't know why!"
"that he went from 0 to 100 in 2 seconds"
"i told him today that his working out stuff is weird"
yep
lol
"but i've said this about him before"
"he just sounds like he's bipolar and having a manic episode"
"of course, enc ourage ""no josh"""
"and encourage ""new beginnings"""
"chris is like, super excited to get me to VA beach so he can try to cut me off from the world"
yeahhh
"even after w eleave"
"just everything before we leave"

"HUGE FAVOR"
"HUGE FAVOR DUDE"
"it would give me insane anxiety"
"i used to"
"i have such a high aversion to it"
"i dont know what it is"
wow
"yea like...dude i cant explain how much i hate phone calls.  earlier chris asked me to please call my dad, and as SOON as i read the word ""call"" my blood started boiling and i lost my shit on him"
"I don't think I should give it to you. It doesn't feel right. I'll talk to my mom, or better yet talk to john about it for you first"
"hm...can i have his email address?"
"and he logs the emails in his notes"
"that's what I do when I'm not able to see him"
"email corrospondance or something"
"but you need to work something out with him"

"well i really dont have a time window to see him before i leave though"
"just saying this out of concern"
"but it doesn't last forever haha"
"everything is going well"
"like you get that super self cofidence"
"I've been super manic before and thought that"
"that is actually a common thought. Once you feel mroe stable you feel lik eyou don't need it. Even at your best, you usually still need it. Saying it causes ""more stress"" is an excuse not to take meds or talk to someone because it's simpler."
"and that going to a psych is actually more stress for me"
"i might just tell them im done? i dont know dude i feel like i dont need medication anymore"
"no, i dont think i have time to see him and get one"

1995?
"what is this"
"people have been making robin williams their profile photo"
dude
hahahahaha
seriously
"and he fucking shared disney's flubber and made it his like background"
"everyone has been sharing photos from their favorite robin williams films"
like
"fucking marks de whatever"
dude
"STRANGE CHOICE"
"NO NOT NO AT ALL NOT NO"
NO
"wonderful timing"
yep
"OH NO"
"OH NO"
"and then he was like, robin williams killed himself"
"josh had just told me he wished he had killed himself"
"when i learned"
like
dude
"WTF DUDE"
"like legitimately upset"
"can we briefly talk about how I kind of got really upset when I learned robin williams had died"
"that keeps up a certain wall that needs to be there while at the saem tiem being a good freind"
"don't suggest anything"
"encourage him to do what makes him happy"
"MY point exactly"
"exactly.  also i dont want him to think im trying to manipulate him. i really do just want him to be happy.  also if i encourage him moving to VA, that will make it look like i want him to move with ME."
"you really don't know"
"but like"
"like not in a negative way"
"and who knows what will happen"
"because you will be makign an emotionall contribution that's far beyond what you've made before"
"don't help TOO much"
"that's a good point"
yeah
"i dont want to get too close?"
"i just wish i could help in some way but at the same time"
"there's one that's more rewarding"
"but like I said"
"and there isn't a wrong answer"
"where you have to pick a door"
"it happens several times in your life"
"he may be at that ""point"" again"
"and not know what to do"
"where he cares enough to do something"
"i dont want him to miss this pivotal point in time"
"I get that"
"i would enjoy having him in VA"
"and to be quite frank"
"this is probably the only time he will have a reason to get out of charleston"
"i feel like"
exactly!
yas
"all of them lead to your ultimate fate, and you wil llikely end up happy at some point. But there's one thats ""more"" correct. There's one choice in life that you could make that would change EVERYTHING. You NEVER know if you've made it until you look back and realize you hadn't."
"like say there are three"
"all of the doors you get to pick in lfie"
"he is jealous of my vicious entrepreneurial spirit"
"I had this conversation yesterday"
"i know.  im kind of worried that he is seeing me do all the things he wish he could have, and really our life paths are strangely similar with the exception of my better decision making"
"that would be a big change"
"I don't know how that would work for him"
well
interesting
hm
"i feel like he is spoiled and probably will only work where he can dress how he wants.  the one job he did mention was working at a record store.  he just wants to do something he enjoys."
"that's not totally out of reach at all, plus those are very good jobs"
"tell him to apply for a management/assistant management job at like a large office supply chain or electronics store if he's unhappy with work."
"Being a supervisor gives a lot of weight to your resume"
"that would work well"
"but he hates working at a call center"
"i suggested he apply at another call center because of his experience"
"but i dont know how to go about helping him"
"i think that's the problem"
exactly
yes
"he is VERY routine"
"in general"
"making a huge life change"
"handle what? moving?"
"exactly, so its very frustrating"
"how would he handle this?"
"he has spent his whole ""adult"" life there"
"you've been at tm for two and some odd years"
"you are young"
"you can switch like that"
right
"and he hates himself for it"
"because this is all he has evern known"
"he said leaving VA Beach was the biggest mistake he has ever made"
"That one is tough"
"yes i agree 100% anbd that relates to what im saying here honestly.  this whole thing where josh is really unhappy with his job but has NO idea what else he would do...i feel totally helpless. like, i honestly have no idea what to even suggest he do.  he is completely lost and unhappy and i dont like it."
"and go ahead"
"I think we are both the kind of people who know exactly what we want. It makes us sound obsessive or hyper determined, but we just already know."
"dude for one second before i forget, let me vent a little and possibly you can offer advice"
"and yeah you're right"
"like the selfishness/introvertedness I guess"
"It is in some small aspects but honestly both focuses bring the same results"
"I talked to joy about this, and her thing was like ""he probably wouldn't support you in things like you'd want if something were to happen"""
"I agree. That is a huge turn on. But based on my own observations, he's more interested in the lifestyle that goes with being successful rather than the success itself. Which is different than what I think, but is it, really?"
"hahaha those all sound like good things, sounds like stuff i would totally be interested in.  the fact that he is working so hard towards his goals and values luxury is A+++"
"I think I just touched the surface here, or maybe that's all."
"So obviously I'm really attracted to him..like if I could think of what the ideal guy would look like, it would be every aspect of him. He's a music performance major, which means he's artsy and also kind of a geek, but he's going to law school which means he's smart. But he's more interested in living a comfortable lifestyle than being philanthropic, which is different than me. I see him as the side of myself that's selfish, and it makes me want to be with him. He's like really into fashion I think, and I've never once laid eyes on him and didn't think about how good he looks/how ridiculously put together he is. He's got a good sense of humor and it's not hard to make him laugh. He has this huge dog that is so close with him that he like wimpers if they aren't in the same room together, which is probably the cutest thing ever."
"tell me"
okay
"that is what's going to happen"
"I can tell you what I like about him and you tell me if it makes sense based on what you know about me, which I think it does based on my past relationships haha"
"so i can only go by what you tell me"
"honestly from what i knew of keifer it sounds like he has changed a lot"
right
"not close with many people here"
"Like I said he's very private"
"he isnt giving people stuff to go by"
"i think it's way too early for you to be able to analyze much.  it sounds like he also understands analyzing people, otherwise he would be more open with his thoughts."
"you're probably right"
"he would have had to go pretty far back  I think"
"he porbably would have said something about it"
HOwever
"but he wouldn't have"
"nah if he read back that far he would have said something about it or contacted you about it"
"but he didn't seem to know specifics"
haha
"there's also that chance that he read further back than I thought and knows...a lot more than what I think he does. Which would be bad right now because nothing came of it"
"We haven't been good friends in a lot of years...however, we have seen each other and we have talked all through our lives periodically. If he's ever felt anything for me, it would be worth pursuing. I think it makes sense. It's not like he seemed surprised anyway."
"he obviously is like that from what youve told me"
"it comes down to this I think..."
"expect him to throw you off"
"but yea so"
"I getcha"
yeah
right
"I just brought her up"
"I didn't tell him I knew of course"
"that is weird haha"
Hahaha
"And I asked him about it and he's not interested"
HAHAHA
"Lolol he told mike he wants to fuck this new girl"
"of course he is"
haha
jesus
Lol
"Yea I mean...josh is still pretending to be interested in other girls here just to throw people off"
"The worst thing he could of said was like, ""wow that's weird"" or maybe something worse, but he kept it pretty neutral with an undertone of ""I've thought about this before"""
Right
"doesn't say ANYTHING"
"his response"
"based on what she told me"
"That's what I'm saying"
"Even if he was he wouldn't have said so"
"I mean guys like that don't show if they're interested"
"Let me think about this"
"Hahaha well"
"Is that the only possible sign of interest? Explicit and undeniable enthusiasm?"
"like what was expected? ""OH NO IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER""

No, just, no."
"kiefer went through joys texts, found out I came out by reading things I had said to her, and then was like ""well, that makes sense."" That was interpreted as general disinterest because like his eyes didn't light up like a little kid at a candy shop. Which I think is a sweeping generalization especially considering how closed off he is"
but
"first off, this probably wasn't cool to do lol"
okay
"and you tell me what you make of this"
"here's why I keep getting told that this isn't happening"
"someone who doesnt let others walk on them"
"it's just"
"a challenge"
"me as well"
yes
"I kind of like that in a person"
"which i am so fine with"
haha
"is at least a little bit of an asshole"
"that anyone who holds you off for that long"
"and i have had to tell myself this"
"then again, always be aware"
"haha yes this is going to take some time but will probably be worth it in the end"
"I DO"
"i know lol"
"i know that you could have whoever you wanted but youre frustrated because you want him NOW"
"they dont know you, whoever it is lol"
"I talked to someone about this and they told me to settle last night which really made me mad. as if like there's no way I would have a ""chance"""
"you just see them as different because he is ""unattainable"" currently"
right
"there are a million things about him that I like and they all seem so different from me but maybe they aren't so different"
"and we are quite similar"
"yes, i am JUST learning this because i have like josh for over a year and only a month ago have i been actually able to get to know him"
"that is a really true fact"
"YOURE RIGHT"
"he may seem different now, but you and i are pretty narcissistic.  if you like him this much, it's because you recognize something that you like a lot and probably display, yourself"
"He's just so different from me. It's like everyone I want to be with is pretty different from me."
"hahaha yea dont do that"
"I think it would be really easy to get drunk and fuck him. that's easy in general. all you need is to be drunk and want to have sex. that's not the ultimate goal here though so that's not worth it"
"let him do it"
"yeah you're right"
"dont even bring up anything sexual or anything like that"
"not sex"
"about common interests"
"start talking to him"
"in the meantime"
"you might as well look elsewhere for a bit"
"which is why this is gonna take time"
"right, exactly"
"and it has been for a long long time"
"but it's obviously much deeper than that for me"
"I would kind of be okay with just casual sex. that way I get get over it but still have my cake and eat it too. which is also why I would be okay with ""no"" because I could just....get over it"
lol
sadly
"what im saying is, you have to become close to him before anything can happen"
"who knows, it's somewhere in there"
lol
"and was sort of rude"
"and he was like, this is the worst possible way to talk to me"
"i messaged him on FB"
"yes this would be where"
"Maybe even further back because you know, I haven't talked to him haha"
"this is definitely a long term project and youre just now realizing that, you can choose to give up or continue.  youre about where i was when josh told me he would never date me"
ok
haha
"listen to me on this one"
"so maybe"
"i know"
"which is exactly whats happening"
"its hard to get people to reciprocate feelings or thoughts when they are purposefully trying to close people out"
"the hardest one to snare"
"the brooding, no friends guy"
"sounds very similar to something i dealt with for a very long time haha"
"my expectations are always too high. Like right now they even aren't that high comparatively, but there is such a slim chance that he has even thought about me like this, but not even that it's not as if he would talk about it because everyone who knows him says he's very closed off and has very few friends and doesn't like to talk about things"
"but honestly, my main advice for this issue would be to put it on the back burner and sort of forget about it.  tend to it when you have time but focus on something else.  that's how i dealt with this when it happened to me."
"i would just say maybe dont set your expectations as high"
"well your feelings and thoughts are very real, as well as your expectations"
"it isn't real"
"because It's pretend"
"I just want to be over this"
"I don't think it is"
"maybe thats what youre working on"
"whenever i cry a lot it almost feels like sadness slowly leaving my body"
"dude why am I still sad. I hate to complain but I cried for like an hour before I could fall asleep. I am still REALLY sad."
"It happens on occasion"
"Its real pain"
"yes sort of"
HAHAHA
"IN your kidneys"
like
hahaha
"Can you ache for water?"
"no that's gas or phantom pain or you were at a fight club and got kidney punched"
"Like when you stand up there's a sharp generalized pain in the area"
hahaha
"I kind of understand that"
"I need all the water"
"Or so shit"
"Dude my kidneys hurt"
"Yes I'm sure haha"
"I probably did too actually"
"it's okay. You needed to sleep"
Friend
"I'm sorry I left you hangin"
"Hi dere"
hi
"Yes. I'm just going to drink and cry. That's what I need to do. Go to sleep"
":/ can we talk tomorrow? I definitely need some sleep"
"But like I know everything I just said is true. Yet I still want him. I actually don't think I've been this sad about it. I'm having to face that it won't happen. It's not like I really tried to find out anyway"
"Because you've idealized him as the perfect person lol"
"He's kind of mean and pretty self absorbed and pretentious. Like so different from me. Why am I so sad"
"I am so sad right now and I don't know if it's artificial"
"Is close to or exactly how they turn out to be"
"Normally the way I see people"
"Strangely though"
"Yes I understand and have been there many times"
"Does that make sense"
"I have idealized someone I don't even know on a personal level at all and I am so sad because I don't know them but I can't tell if what I feel is based completely on what I want them to be"
""
"I think I do"
"Umm maybe a little bit"
?
"Do I idealize people"
"The things that come through my head have to be verbalized though hahaha"
"To say the least"
Odd
"I'm sorry my male personality is"
"Word up son"
hahaha
"middle of the mall shit"
Damn
"Middle of the mall shit"
"Get out ta here with that"
"You plebe"
"That's so funny to me like"
"really way too into fb yardsale type of folks"

"Scented oils"
"Yes hahaha dude there are people at work that sell like"
"and perfumes"
"old clothes"
"but like"
"not like your reptiles"
"i hate when people try to sell things on facebook"
"And I was like, shut up, I like him"
"He messaged me making fun of josh today"
"He is delusional"
"If he is unclear on something"
"Hahaha I have had to rehash everything like three times"
haha
"those were probably foggy to him"
"but he is a mess still"
"you were"
"I feel like maybe that's not nice but I mean, I was clear with my intentions"
Lololol
"Its something to do"
"Well I don't WANT to have sex with Chris but I mean"
dying

"I thought I was clear on that"
"I don't want to have sex with bella"

"Hahaha I'm so jealous"
"SEE HOW EASY IT IS HUNDER"

Fuuuuuck
"I missed my appointment with john today"

"like she cried"
"this was so hard"
"what if like"
Laaame
"she hasn't answered ._."
"Yea I totally understand that."
"she shouldn't reevaluate our romantic history, because it's a good one that I kind of cherish you know. I don't want her to think that it changes anything that we had."
"I just tried to make it clear that she"
"I don't even think there's anything to get over"
"Yea I mean, she'll get over it haha"
"I was okay with what I said"
"but It was managable"
"it was hard to type"

"I am not sure if I'm gonna drink again tonight, but This conversation kind of makes me want to. Will my liver and kidneys fail if I get drunk four nights in a row?"
hahaha
"yeah word"
"except now, sex is actually more exciting now that im not tied to him"
"I get what you mean"
"all sex with chris has been forced"
"for the last year"
"i feel like"
"that's odd"
"Bella was just...bad at sex in every aspect. It was so boring and unimaginative that I didn't even look forward to it. There was almost this element that was like ""fake passion"" where she tried so hard to be into it and it was just not sincere, haha"
?
"you know something I have realized recently"
dude
"Turns out, I can. haha. shockingly enough"
*failed
hahahaha
"but mine fialed"
"i just now have gotten to the point of being able to"
"i dont know dude, some people cant have a non emotional sexual relationship"
"I JUST WANT FRIENDSHIPS"
well
so
haha
"he definitely has a weird thing for me obviously"
but
"someone I could definitely be friends with"
"I was like ""oh yeah send me your snap chat name"""
"I hooked up with this guy last night, who in retrospect, I'm not really even attracted to at all. I was just super drunk. And he spent all night like talking to me and saying like REALLY nice things about me, like maybe a little past flirting (?). But I kept just like nodding my head and saying things like ""oh yeah we would definitely be good friends, we'll hang out next time I'm here."" but it was like, him talking about how interesting I was, pretty like overtly sexual stuff, ect ect. I have been talking to him all day, but just as a friend. WHY is it, that people can't separate emotions from things? It makes it really awkward. I do not know how to handle this situation hahaaha"
go
"my turn."
yes
"tell me"
"I have an issue"
like
"so dude"
"i agree"
right
"there's a nice middle ground"
"one introvert and one extrovert type of thing"
"but you don't want like"
"you don't want two personalities that are very strong"
"yeah his personality doesn't quite match with yours"
"a little bit of a bitch"
"hes just"
"i dont know if i could ever fully commit to him"
"i dont know dude"
"i mean"
"thats what im saying haha"
"he still may"
"he should have gornw out of it"
"but he's 25"
"he may grow out of it"
"I mean"
but
"he is a little bit of a baby"
"i cant say anything at all"
"chris is being a baby"
"im jealous of that"
right
"we are at that ""adult"" level of interacting"
"I am so glad I'm over bella for the most part dude. I mean I don't  see a need to, but I could have a conversation with her like that"
hahaha
OH
"what do you mean"
lol
"or he will cry, puke, or yell at me"
"cant talk about certain aspects"
"i just"
"thats really true, i can do what i want"
"they belong to you"
"who cares what he thinks about your actions"
hahaha
"just ignore him"
"dude he's bveen making fun of me for stupid things and he obviously still cant deal with the josh thing. like, he was making fun of my ""scabby knees"" and then said something about it being rug burn, even though that sounds insane.  i was pissed"
hahaha
"a family to provide for, and a wife that makes him dinner"
like
"like I know what he wants"
gah
like
"i know dude"
"chris just has this weird patriarchal complex that is super internalized and probably wont go away unless he MAKES it go away"
"its just not possible"
"you cant do that while tied down to a house and kids"
"me too"
"and truly get the full experience out of life"
"i just want to have adventures"
"most people do not get so obsessive"
"No for everyone"
"to me at least"
"exactly, thats background shit for while real life is happening"
"why obsess over it"
"you have intimate relationships"
"you meet people"
"why would you need to fixate on it"
"because that stuff just happens anyway"
"or emotional"
"nothing personal"
like
"have a baby"
"not like"
"but they're like ""find a vaccine for schizophrenia"""
"i hate feeling like my life is even slightly predetermined"
"I have goals"
see
ew
"help meeee hahaha"
"dude the other day chris told me his goal is still to marry me one day, he was like ""it will happen"""
to
"hahahaha why"
avacoda
"""he'll be back later"""

"i mean, i think i deserve someone who works like me"
"I won't either"
"i will not settle"
correct
yes
JAJA
"you are not"
"okay with settling"
"just enough to get by"
"I mean chris is like your subaverage joe"
"i know dude, it feels like he is behind me.  josh actually asked me what im looking for in another person, after talking to me about why chris and i dont work.  i basically told him i need someone with goals and a good work ethic. im tired of pulling all of the weight"
"like he is ""behind"" or something"
"He must feel ""rushed"""
"he is 25, and has barely scratched the surface of what you have been able to combat intrapersonally"
"you are making all of these great changes in your life at 20"
"but you do have to consider this"
"that whole settling down family thing"
"I still think chris in some way or another thinks thats what needs to be"
"yes, exactly.  but that's the only reason i would consider any sort of long term relationship, because it would be non committal and i have already told him that i am NOT focusing on finding a family and settling down right now, thats partially why chris and i arent working"
"Loving him would almost be irrelevant due to this fact anyway"
"and I think you're not at the point in your life where you're searching for that singular person either"
"but i wouldnt act on that simply because it wouldnt be healthy"
"all i know for sure is that when im with him, im happy"
"but he isnt asking me to"
"and in no position to commit to anything"
"i like him a lot but right now im in no position to use the term ""love"""
"what do you ""make"" of that"
well
ok
hm
"But he has given me the best advice while I've been around him, he obviously cares quite a bit about me and is decently protective over me. It makes me feel really nice. It seems he really appreciates me and honestly I have a whole lot of fun with him, and he is VERY similar to me behaviorally"
"ok ok ok"
"Take me seriously now please, for like ten minutes lolol"
Hahahaha
"""say what you need to say"""
well
"I don't know how I feel about this. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about it really."
"i mean you don't have much more time with him htough"
haha
"I would be done"
"If i didn't love someone and they loved me"
"I wouldn't like that"
hmmm
"Like, he is in love with me to some degree at least. He told me not to end up like him, and almost cried, and then hugged me like he was holding onto life itself."
"that seems kind of intense"
yeah
*
wow
eoe
"I don't know exactly but I like fell asleep cuddling him and he kept telling me how beautiful I am and how perfect and how he has so much fun with me and how he is going to miss me, it has progressed to emotional dependence I think. At least on his end."
"what d oyou mean"
"He was pretty upset, he didn't explain. He actually sent me a crying sad face. I feel like I accidentally signed on to something last night."
"what do you mean"
"Dude today josh messaged me and said our vice president ""slandered"" him and that he wants to leave but doesn't know what to do with his life"
"I know. I'm sorry :("
"I may be able to. We have to pack so much dude I hate it D:"
"You should go with me like wednesday after work to look for some furniture. I think that's what in doing this week"
"To be honest I'm kinda okay with this. I was sad I had to leave. Haha"
"I want to go but Chris would not accompany me"
"Yeah exactly haha"
"Dammit haha I would get back at 1 am"
"2 1/2 hours away about."
"Wait so how far is that?"
Hahaha
"you did freak that one time"
haha
"dude I'm in morgantown"
"I would go get you if I wasn't so afraid of Columbus at night lolol, the interstates ruin my life"

hahaha
"maybe like a 3, very low"
"I am okay with a certain threshold"
"like on a scale of 1-10 how weird is it to hit that ""add"" button if someone hasn't given you their info? haha"
"yes i would do that"
"snapchat is such a casual thing. Would it be weird, If I approached this ""issue"" of mine by adding him on snapchat-even though he didn't actually give me his name on there? It almost seems like a really detached way to get to know someone"
"tell me and ask"
yes
"I have an idea"
"can i ask you a question"

"I am so happy recently dude. I thought I couldn't be any happier, but it turns out I can be."

"Dude you're helping him so much"
"Yea that's a great conversation"
"Thay isn't split perfectly but you can basically see what was said by who"
"It's just very confusing to me. The closest thing I've ever been able to identify as is ""pan sexual""
Pansexual means you don't only have some sort of attraction to the binary genders, but to people who are agender, genderfluid, and androgynous. Which describes you, because hunter's gender is fluid
Politically speaking, if a man is attracted to a woman who identifies as agender, he is bi, no matter how feminine she is.
he/she/they*
is
/are

I've always read it described as falling in love with personalities and having feelings toward other people regardless of gender and physical form.
not technically no
I mean that's just  tricky
that's liek saying you don't feel physical attraction only emotional
pansexuality is more
indiscriminate sexuality
like it includes all genders
all identification"
"Here's what was said"
"I don't quite get that"
"I explained to him ""pansexuality"""
"Hahahaha on gender stuff?"
"I am giving chris the biggest run down right now"
"LIKE MEEEEEE"
"Which will be tricky"
"I will have to move in on the 15th though"
"Just waiting on one phone calk confirming"
"I know. We were supposed to get a 2 bedroom but all of a sudden they didn't have any, and I said, we'll take a one bedroom"
hahah
"you have something"
"Dude whatever"
"It's something"
But
"So I think we just got a one bedroom"
"Hahahahaha wonderful"
"which it's not"
"then I was pushed into a corner in which I was forced to come out to him, and then explain that being queer is no excuse for queer bashing"
"""I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR"""
"and I said"
"he kept typing"
"And then after some stuff"
"Well, the way you conveyed this confusion didn't look great. The vernacular was pretty harsh. Don't apologize to me, you don't owe me anything."
"post apology:"
"Okay lol"
"let me say this first"
WELL
HAHAHA
"OH MY GOD"
"I JUST TOLD HIM"
wow

"He is so repressed dude"
"He like referenced some instance where he grabbed my ass and I don't remember it"
"He's repressed man"
Lolol
"as I currently try to get with a guy"
lol
"so chris just told me he's bisexual and he's sorry if that makes me uncomfortable"
"I want to."
"come over after work and drink a bunch of wine"
"Yes I'm seeing that now."
"You can just be you. Just fluctuating between the different facets of your own identity. which for EVERYONE, encompasses lots of things"
"don't think of it as binary even if you don't want. Calm and powerful are valid terms. Let your internal manifestation speak in the way you  choose to direct it,"
"Yes I can say, this feels powerful or this feels calm"
"more intrinsic"
"Less objective"
"how do I feel?"
"but more like"
"""oh wow that was really manly"""
"Yea I need to keep reading. In the car with Chris. About to speak with him and see if he's lying."
"I can't say"
"it's YOU"
"no one can"
"I can't say how you feel when you feel it"
"judge for yourself."
"when you get the time just read into gender fluidity"
like
"I don't know"

"it could be"
"My BPD is much less severe now?"
"that's all it is"
"gender is performative"
"what if"
dude
"Yep I sent him that already lol"
"this is an interesting sentiment"
"Butler characterizes gender as the effect of reiterated acting, one that produces the effect of a static or normal gender while obscuring the contradiction and instability of any single person's gender act. This effect produces what we can consider to be ""true gender"", a narrative that is sustained by ""the tacit collective agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders as cultural fictions is obscured by the credibility of those productions â and the punishments that attend not agreeing to believe in them.""[1]"
lolol
"i know dude"
well
"hot damn"
"at work, neither of us can see it (ticket nazis)"
"not in greast detail"

"he seems much more okay now that he has admitted to some things himself"
"i think he was fighting me because he was so represseD?"
"he said he notices me become more masculine when we go to the farm"
"""You're a lot different when you're in gecko mode.  4:07 PM

"Good I mean it's true"
"i sort of just told him that"
"i agree"
yes
"He won't even think twice about changing a thought just because he thinks he knows everything there is to know. At this point in time, there are more facts than opinions and he relies on ignorance to cling to incorrect facts so he can feel good about not understanding important things"
"He uses you."
"He is selfish"
"Okay well...His ignorance of simple requests which compiles into this collective selfishness that he always described"
"Do you have particular examples of him being mean? I can only think of maybe a handful but I'm conditioned to it."

"He said that last night and I told him he CANNOT say that around ANYONE because it is HIGHLY OFFENSIVE"
"HE IS ON EVERY LEVEL"
HAHAHAHAA
"He said that black people are not the same species as white people"
"he went outside so he didnt ""lose his shit"", and then googled the definition of ""bigot"", sent it to me, and said ""see, im none of these things, so im not a bigot"""
"so much"
"i love you guys"
"well still"
"ahh okay"
"So not leaving for good I'll be back monday"
"No to morgantown."

"i need to tell him too"
"can we have another michael, hunter, trevor night?"
"all dee way to ohio?"
"I'm doing nothing but I just have a bus to catch at 10 something in the morning haha"
"my lips have gone numb, i guess from stress"

"That's too bad but not shocking that he that he can't grasp"
"dude what are you doing tonight?"
"i give up on him"
"im talking to him now, and telling him factyually everything that he is saying that is offensive and exactly why it is not okay"
"i understand lol"
"I didn't reply. I can't have that deep of of a convo. I'm just outside at work lo"
"otherwise he would"
"hes working right now so he cant message you"
"If If he wants educated I can do that but I think we're past that"
"That means nothing to me. He won't accept your feelings. His words are useless"
"i guess"
"yep i dont think he is just saying it though, he has ""done stuff"" with guys as an adolescent so its in there somewhere"
"I hope he's not lying because again I've struggled with that my entire life and saying it to level some petty conversation is beyond my ability to self control"
"I told him he needs to ask you to help him understand.  But I won't push him on you right now lol.  Apparently he is ""attracted to guys"", which could be true, but also could not be."
"Like what would he even say if he knew I wasn't straight. Like I can't imagine how narrow minded his reaction would be based on how he reacted to what you said. That alone is enough to make my gears grind"
"well i hope you can at some point because i dont like burned bridges"
"I refuse to even entertain conversation with him right now"
"He He just said ""I've been trying all day"""
"I messaged chris earlier and said ""stop"""
"It's like if I came out to you and said "" I always knew it."" That's the equivalent emotionally of what chris has done done to respond to everything you've ever told him"
"just, he hasnt said whatever it is"
"i actually dont even know what i want chris to say"
"and care, even"
"you and josh understand totally"
"living with him is going to suck major ass"

yes
except
lol
"What I had like a week ago"
"a revelation"
"im having like"
"YOU ARENT"
"wow dude"
NOPE
"i thought i was just fucked in the head"
"i had no idea i had any sort of definition to identify as"
"I know what you're saying"
"and it doesnt feel weird when i say those things"
"I'm glad you're thinking about this stuff. It helps to know that you DO fit in"
"i mean...ive always said male things like ""this guy"" or ""suck my dick"""
"*big hug*"
"thank you michael"
"I love helping"
"i have been afraid to say anything"

"And I'm also very analytical by nature"
"I'm just trying to absorb all of what you're saying"

truly
"it goes back and forth throughout the day"
"its not always like that"
"that is totally legitimate dude"
"and more feminine outside of work"
"if you feel more masculine at work"
"but like"
haha
"even though in the grand scheme of things, the complicated answer makes more sense"
"but it's a real challenge to think past what you've always identified as man vs woman"
"like your feelings are valid"
"This is internalized misogyny. Identifying ""man"" as a hard worker but ""woman"" as someone who has fun is incorrect. A woman can also be a workaholic. But, because of patriarchal society, people don't think woman when they think workaholic. The same way you don't think....Woman rapist, or white gangbanger. It's all relative. I'm not discounting your feelings about gender, but I just wanna make sure to reinforce that you don't need to base these feelings on gender ""roles."" like man work woman entertain"
okay
"let me correct something here"
but
"I believe you."
"when im out with friends, i become a female"
"like, when im working, i channel the work ethic and drive of a workaholic male"
"but i genuinely do feel masculine or feminine at any given moment"
lol
"I don't think anyone has traits that are all masculine or all feminine"
"In my opinion"
"as a person"
"like saying it does't make sense to you"
"like ignoring the standard ""man vs woman"" ideal"
"binary rejection?"
"OH yeah that's definitely a binary rejection lol"
"because i dont feel like sex is what i should do"
"i want to like, cuddle and watch tv"
"sometimes i dont even want to have sex"
"you can normally tell by the make up and type of pants im wearing"
"but still, i feel male a lot"
"and i am literally a different gender"
"I HAVE ACCEPTED BEING FEMININE IN SOME ASPECTS"
"AND NOW I KNOW WHY"
"everyone around here has been saying im a ""different person"""
"Okay go ahead!"
"okay so"
"LET ME EXPLAIN"
like
"YES THE SECOND ONE IS 100% ME"
"This are specific definition haha"
"so bigender is definitely ""some part of me is man"" ""some part is woman""

Gender fluidity is almost like saying you don't feel proper identifying as either because depending on the context you go back and forth between what people consider ""masculine"" and ""feminine"""
"be clear"
okay
"but like let me be clear"
"yeah that's gender fluidity"
"I'm so into queer theory so ANYTIME DOOD"
"sometimes aman"
"sometimes a girl"
"i have always felt like"
"im glad youre here to educate me haha"
"I love educating people on this stuff"
YAY
"A lot of these things people proabbly feel, and don't understand that it's okay"
"that describes me perfectly."
"yeah gender fluid isn't rejecting man and woman, but kind of accepting them both depending on the situation"
"so gender fluid"
"in what way are you thinking of that"
"""gluid"""
"I mean"
"hmmm so"
ok
"okay let me just use an example right here... martin just walked in and said ""whats up, pretty?"""
"there's bigender which is elements of being a man and a woman"
erm
"I will educate you on these very quickly.  Gender gluid is feeling like you fluctuate between two binary genders, Agender literally means without gender because the current ideas of man and woman don't quite fit with how they feel"
"whats it called?"
YES
"is there a name for a person who doesnt necessarily identify with an exclusive gender?"
"even now, even today, and probably forever, i identify with a lot of successful male figures"
"just fucking now"
"""forcing kids to stick to gender roles can be harmful to their health"""
"look what jamee just shared"
omg
"just wow"
like
"i am..."
lol
"you are one of millions of examples of the rejection of women"
"that is exactly what's wrong with society"
"because then, who would be the male figure and fix everything?"
"ii wasnt able to be that"
"because women are notorious for being ""too emotional"""
"and try to ""reason"" everything to keep her sane"
"so i was forced to assume a male role there"
"also, i was raised in a household with a single mother who was usntable"
"to be a male"
"i was raised"
"wow so"
hahaha
ok
yeah
that's
yeahhhh
"he taught me how to drive by letting me take the yellow bronco up on the hill"
"he bought me a gun for my report card when i was 12"
"as his son..."
"sees me"

"its very very obvious"
"i mean, im obviously his favorite"
"i know"
"that's very freudian"
"except me"
yeah
"ahh i see"
"every son he has has disappointed him to some extent"
but
"I mean by coming to terms with yourself and your own needs and happipiness it will go away"
"i was the son that my dad never got to have"
Yeah
"male-centric world"
"a misogynist"

"Which explains why you call women bitches and shit hahahahahahahahahahahaha"
"they encouraged me to have basically no friends and just go play outside"
"There's no like excuse that needs to be made sex is sex and every living mamal does it"
"my whole life growing up, everyone in my family discouraged any type of sex"
YES
"as long as you arent diseased lol"
"it's STUPID"
"whore is just a term invented by men to make women feel bad about liking sex"
"it's okay to be a whore though"
Like
RIGHT
"so its hypocrisy"
"because i can technically define myself as a whore"
"i have tried to stop using the word whore, actually"
hahaha
"and now I hope you realize that whore is a stupid term and concept, women are generally not ignorant people just are, and moms are generally not evil yours jsut is"
"like i could knock a woman's teeth out"
"i still feel like a dominant male sometimes"
"and i found it ""interesting"" to see stupid whores, ignorant women, getting what they deserve, because of my mom, because she ruined my whole life"
"LIKE HARDCORE"

"JUST NOW"
"I FIGURED IT OUT"

hahahahaahaha
"Oh you'd be surprised"
"but i dont hate myself for it"
lol
"ive done saome weird shit that is still a little too weird for me to admit to"
"BUT I DIDNT KNOW"
"I KNOW"
"that's totally fine"
dude
HAHAHA
hahaha
"that would usualyl take alcohol to get out of me"
because
"I say sober secret"
lol
"Sober secret: I've talked to guys online my whole life anyway, so I've CONSTANTLY hated everything. I WAS LIKE WHAT IF SOMEONE KNEW"
hahahaha
"I didn't have it"
"(YES they are finding them)"
"whatever gene that is required"
"i did however connect with the earth at a young age"
"but like"
"I tried to"
"so i never followed ""god"""
"but i never connected with ""god"""
"i was raised around religion"
"well bascally with me"
hahaha
"like INSANE shit like that"
"like I haven't been a christian since i was young but I still wake up feeling like some kind of god hates me. EVEN THOUGH theologians generally agree the bible doesn't say that."
"you shouldnt"
"its hard at first because you feel bad but"
"I realize this now"
"no dude, you need to be whoever you are and apologize to no one about it"
"She is dude...."
lolololol
"shes weird"
"THIS IS NEVER LEAVING MY OWN BRAIN"
"OH NO"
"OH NO"
"and then I was like"
"complain about how zach pauley wasn't straight"
"and she would like"
"she is like one of those rich white liberals who loves kids in africa but doesn't understand real issues people have"
"bella made this such a challenge"
"I KNOW I CANT"

"i know dude, that one totally threw me off because i dont like metal AT ALL so I never understood how you could like it, i always knew it was fake..."
"METAL MUSIC"
"ACTUALLY PICKING INTERESTS TO TAILOR THIS FAKE PERSONALITY"
"and like"
"EVERY MOM"
"I've always wanted to be like *stereotypical guy* who ""doesn't care much about how he looks"""
"AND ALL MOMS"
hahaha
"I totally understand that..because my situation was eerily similar. We can thank patriarchy and christians for that. oh, and obama. definitely obama."
"i look nearly ""normal"""
"since all this has happened, ive been dressing in feminine clothes"
"if that makes sense?"
"well, you know my entire ""emo"" ""dress like a dude"" thing was basically because i didnt have any faith in myself as a human.  i didnt want to take a confident feminine role because i thought others would laugh at me or call me ugly, so i decided to be the ""girl who looks pretty good for someone dressed like a dude"""
"whatever you wanna say"
talk
Yes
"jesus god"
"GOD DAMN IT the only other person I've talked to about this just sent me a snapchat of kiefer hahahahaha"
"this is too weird"
"can i explain?"
"but dude im kind of doing the same thing"
lol
"dont say that, ill cry"
"our charleston based friendship is over"
"then it's like"
"yeah we have a week"
"but dude"
"that's who I am at heart haha. Part of my whole emo get up was repressing that. Same thing with dressing like shit and acting like i ""dont care"" about things. Anything that could be interpreted as feminine was like NO OUT"
"nothing to be ashamed of haha"
"so it makes sense"
"you were very comfortable with being preppy soccer dude"
"it is odd that youre into keifer but to be honest, i kind of saw that side of you in middle school"
"WE WILL"
"I will be down to visit"
"he suggested that we all go do something fun before we all leave"
BUT
"I'm gonna miss chris too"
"It's so weird dude, like the kind of guy I'm attracted to is like really pretty/preppy...and I think that's pretty different than me. hahah."
"chris said he is going to miss you"
hahaha
lolololol
"the others were just closeted"
"it counts for nothing"
"oh wait, no"
"if that counts for anything"
"he's the first bi person ive had feelings for"
hahahahaha
HAHAHA
"imagine you were in the closet your entire life and josh was the first woman you openly had feelings for."
but
"and also you're exactly right about that last part"
haha
"well here's where my situation is gonna be a little more tricky..."
"the worst that can happen...is nothing"
"but because i took the chance, it worked out"
"and ill have blown my chance"
"i was like, he's going to be a superviser and answer my question and then nothing"
"dude i was so scared too"
"BUT I TRY"
"I think that's probably because I have no self esteem"
haha
"I know the things I want to say, I'm just so afraid to even say hi"
"is the hardest part"
"so finding that one thing"
"And just sort of went from there"
"Then finally I asked him about woirking for him"
"It took me about a year to figure out how to contact josh"
"i guess"
"I mean we were friends in high school kind of..we have some things in common. It's just like, we haven't been even remotely more than acquaintances in so many years it's just starting a freidnship again that's weird"
"ok I see"
"and i just built up on that"
"and when i found him sending me links to shoes, i knew he enjoyed talking to me"
"and shoes"
"that's what i did with josh"
"because most people ignore others"
"just befriend him.  If you can build a friendship with him, you're in.  If he talks to you, you're good to go.  You have to just establish that he gives a shit, and if he talks to you even online repeatedly, that shows serious interest"
"ok CHECK"
"Find an interest you guys share, the thing you guys share the most, whatever that may be.  Make sure it is a general thing, not romantic or sexual"

"Here's the thing: It's still really preliminary. Like I'm gonna know more about this soon, because when I go to morgantown I'll probably hangout with him/at least be around him. It's just like, you know, if he's attracted to me and just went for it that would be easier than waiting, but it would also be better to hear a no before I get too involved. At this point he just knows I'm not straight, which opens up the possibility of something, I just hate having to do things like this because I haven't had to in YEARS"
"And it's probably keifer I'm guessing?"
"How long have you been talking to this person?  How often?  What is the content of messages?"

"I'll show him hahaha"
Exactly
"he HAS to"
Yep.
"he has no chocie"
HOWEVER
"because you live together"
"between together and not"
"he's not drawn the line yet"
WORD
"He's dumb"
"If I didn't like what I was doing I wouldn't do it"
"fuck that"
Idiot
"I certainly will. He was like checking my neck for hickeys and shit. He doesn't want me being abused -.-"
"Yea do that"
"Yea hahaha. I need to call him out in the car so he knows to cut it out."
"his passive aggressive behavior is old"
"but his guilt tripping is garbage"
"his opnion as a friend is valued"
"like you are in a plutonic relationship"
"He makes me uncomfortable  lolol"
"his comfort level is ireelevent"
"It is. Chris keeps saying josh feeling for me makes him ""uncomfortable"""
"that is very sad"
wow
"I have to sleep with him. I had to change clothes so I didn't smell like josh so Chris didn't have a break down"
._.
yikes
Lol
"Its getting on my nerves"
"Dude so I'm in bed and Chris is laying beside me, pouting basically"
yes
HAHA
"Starring andy dwyer and dr steve brule"
Loooool
Hahahaha
"I MEAN JOHN C REILLY"
"AND DR STEVE BRULE"
"I need to see it"
YES
"yes hahaha with Bradley Cooper"
"but it's hilarious"
"like it's like an action sci fi deal"
"It is so funny"
"I WANT TO SEE THAT"
"dude I saw guardians of the galaxy today. holy shit. Chris pratt is SHOCKINGLY good in it. I thought it would be so bad"
"I know I'm just horrible at setting limits, I tend to keep giving until I'm used up"
"the limits are yours to set"
"I mean"
"I guess so"
"Not to him?"
"I mean I can just"
"Like he wants me to"
"I guess this is why I can't pretend that we're still together"
"Yes, agreed."
"you need an ACTUAL break from it"
"you just cant right now"
"It makes sense"
"It's not an unreasonable belief"
no
"Well because I think we will still end up together at some point? Or do I actually think that? Am I just trying to change myself to make him happy :/"
haha
"why do you owe him anything at this point"
"but as I said"
"He should know I would never get with josh officially"
"Thats just something he shouldn't be asking me"
"So, oh well"
"But he's making me lie"
"Chris makes me promise I have no feelings for josh"
"He doesn't understand that me having feelings does not mean I'm going to leave him or something. I think Chris is actually afraid I would stay here."
"who cares"
"but chris and you are not together"
"I can't tell him because he doesn't understand"
"And I can't just lie all of the time"
"I don't know, I know I don't have to justify anything to you but Chris gets angry if I act like I care about josh at all"
"all of the things you like to need"
hahaha
"All things I need hahaha"
"It makes me feel a)powerful b)in control and c) loved"
"i can see how that would be a good feeling though"
"It makes me happy to see it"
"I don't know, I just make him a different person and he's so happy"
"Like a kid with a crush"
"Melting in my hands"
"He is now like"
"Within 3 visits"
"Its gotten so bad"
Hahahaha
"*loves* #you"
"not how he"
right
"It is dude...but I'm sort of glad he won't say it because I don't want to. I do love him but in a way that doesn't make for a relationship obviously."
hahahaha
"that's like so sad"
"He's started calling me cute and shit"
"I would swear on anything he accidentally said I love you...and then started repeating ""your (explitive)"" repeatedly to like...cover it up"
"it's excessive"
"like yeah"
hahahah
"Also you have to be right about the territory thing lol"
"We were supposed to continue this once I left but when I mentioned it he said something about how he will probably be gone when I come back, if he's lucky...he wants to escape WV so badly that he's delusional"
"right i mean yeah there will be others most likely"
"But ya know, life goes on"
"yeah :/"
"And I'll miss him"
"yeah I knwo"
"I can't say I don't"
"I do like him though"
hahaha
"benefiting everyone"
HAHA
"yeah you are"
"I GUESS if you look at it that way"
"that is your utilitarian nature"
well
omg
"Its really sweet, I think. Because all he needs is a little attention and he's happy again. I almost feel like I'm doing Ticketmaster a public service hahahahaha"
"BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF YOUR LOVE"
"WOULD KEEP YOU"
"HIM SAYING THAT"
LIKE
"AS IF"
HAHAH
"He told me he will miss me when I leave but he didn't want to say that because he didn't want to discourage me"
hahah
"that's almost...sad"
"Like, almost laughing hysterically"
"Giggles like a school girl when I kiss him"
"He is in love with me"
"Dude like"
Hahahaha
"He wants to mark his territory so when you go home it reminds chris he doesn't have a chance"
"I have a fruedian theory"
Jesus
HAHAHAHAHA
"Also, hickeys this time and somehow bite marks on my legs. Dude is OBSESSED."
"Well cool haha, now I know and life goes on. Also, since we're getting personal, I see that josh left many many marks on my ass from a fucking wire clothes hanger"
haha
"I mean it's not a matter of suspicion haha it's just like, this changes nothing about me, because this has always been me. And as far as our friendship goes, no it doesn't matter. In fact, I may only be with girls for the rest of my life. I just needed to share this because I need to be comfortable with myself."
"That makes a lot of sense, I understand. I never suspected it but I guess I never had reason to look into it because it doesn't matter lol"
"It's a weird thing."
"but like I don't really have the desire to have actual sex with a guy, I've just always been attracted to certain guys. Sexually, yeah. But the idea of penetrative sex is gross to me. Even so, this thought still makes me ""bi"""
"Of course you do lol. And no I am serious. I have found aspects of women to be attractive but never just ""women"""
haha
"i dunno"
"you were trying to be like comforting or something"
"I know what you're saying"
"Lolol I'm an idiot"
"for me"
Well
HAHA
"But I've never wanted to be with a chick so, probably not"
"I'm trying to be. And thanks. I kind of knew you would respond like that haha"
Hahaha
"I could be too, to be honest."
"Oh well, that's all fine and good lol. I still love you the same, and obviously its best to be comfortable in your own skin."
"You don't need to really respond to this in any particular way, by the way"
"So here it goes: I've kind of always known this a little bit, but a lot of things recently of helped bring me to this conclusion and find an easier way to come to terms with it. I'm bi. I just need to say it to you to help me cope with the bullshit that has been crammed into my head my whole life. I have hated myself my entire life and I've repressed this idea and fought it. But I'm ALMOST comfortable with it, and as my bestfriend you should know."
GO
Hahaha
"I DO"
"I am discussing it with no one. Trust n believe."
haha
"Keep in mind that this is personal, and obviously you won't discuss this with josh or chris but I'm just typing to reaffirm that"
"Okee dokee tell me"
"I need to talk to you about somethin dude, it's not like awful or bad, you're just my bestfriend and I owe you the conversation"
"Hahahaha epoch"
"Well sounds like you had a splendid # epoch"
Hahahahaha
HAHA
"So you can't."
"But you could say ""things are getting pretty serious"", except I'm moving in two weeks."
"I swear I heard an ""I love you"" but I'm choosing to ignore it and think I'm crazy"
Well

EXPLANATIOn
WAIT
WAIT
"I'd say that you are a compassionate caring person"
"I mean based on how much we talk"
"I don't get it lol"
"Your desire to be this ""evil"" person is sometimes offputting dude. Like it's almost as if you want to be seen as less caring or evil, when in fact you care a lot and have never been evil"
"dont know."
"i think im pretty much the same though.  just less caring? or maybe more evil."
"I've never changed"
yep
"you just have to be a different person, and things change"
"i guess i just discovered how easy it is to change your reality"
"until now i guess. im assuming the worst of course. barrett could not know."
"i like the secrecy, of course.  it's very private.  it's like a world that no one else is aware of."
"but you like that aspect"
"i know"
"i dont do this intentionally"
"i like josh, believe it or not hahaha"
"im not doing it because im not supposed to"
"I'm boring in that way"
"I just don't understand the thrill of doing things you aren't supposed to be doing by ""definition"""
"because it is supposed to be very privileged information.  and im not so much embarrassed for myself as i am him.  of course i want to hook up with a supervisor.  but for him to be with a 20 year old agent is odd."
"if you're embarrassed by it why are you doing it lol"
"i dont want people to know =/"
"and my heart just sank"
"and then he was like ""you walk around like a different person, what happened? i love your new hair"""
"because barrett came over and was talking to me, being super nice"
how?

"i think martin told my boss dude"
"i really want to be done working here hahaha"

"borderline retarded"
"dude his mom is like"
"and i want to puncxh myself"
"""i have an ideal"""
"chris' mom says"
yesh
(ideas)
"and the ideals"
"just, the laffs"
hm?
hahaha
"see this is why we need to talk"
"jesus looooool"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"OH MY GOD"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"chemtrails are just giant government sky mods"
"also, chris says"
AHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHAHA
"OH NO"
"and then he was like"
"most likely.  he probably didnt realize that paint kills your brain until he starting looking into conspiracies because of his need to feel safe"
haha
"that's why he's always paranoid"
also
"because of paint inhalation"
"he was so paranoid about talking about graffiti"
"I figured"
"kelley and i were talking about that"
lolz
"OH YEAH"
"paint pot"
"too much paint"
also
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"trevor has taken too much pot to the pot"
"HES TAKING TOO MUCH VAPOR TO THE DOME"
HUGE
"trevor has a HUGE confirmation bias based on the NYT newspapaer article"
"IS BECAUSE HE VAPES TOO MUCH"
"the reason chris is being like this"
"he told me"
"trevor WILL NOT believe vaping is not bad"
"yea like"
hahaha
lol
"those are obviously correct"
"but if there's like one or two papers completely disproving it"
"there can be so much evidence on something"
"that conformation bias thing is real important"
"i have to tell chris that hahahaha"
"Chris was unknowingly attacking his identity"
"HAHA yes"
"trevor is the summation of a conspiracy theorist"
"even though he's not"
OHHHH
"n ot his beliefs"
"trevor just sees chris attacking HIM"
"bbut im thinking, NO he does not"
"the other day he said he doesnt like chris because chris gets ""violent"" in the conversations when he argues trevor's logic"
"lok haha"
"LET ME EXPLAIN"
"AND THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE"
"yea dude that's why i never fight trevor"
"so they tend to not be open to new suggestions"
"Attacking a 9/11 truther about their beliefs, is basically an attack on part of their identity. Calling a part of them INVALId. They ARE a TRUTHER"
EX:
"i like the idea of social identity"
"These different identities form the sum of us"
"wait so...how does this tie into bigfoot? are those people just really afraid of bigfoot? lolol"
"Social identity: we all have identities we cling to that our self esteem depends on"
"Millions believing the same thing. They're all scared."
"the social identity aspect"
ALSO
"no matter what you say, the theorist dismisses you"
"and yep, now i can see it"
"wow haha i love the way you laid that out for me, i totally understand"
"tendency to hold on to information that agrees with yours and ignore information that disagrees with yours"
"THE CONFIRMATION BIAS"
FINALLY
"then it's hard to switch back to thinking contextually"
"(effortless thinking)"
"conspiracy theorists are more likely to make sweeping generlizations rather than seeing each element"
"especially in situations with high emotion"
"we always tend towards dispositional becuase it's easier"
"focusing on context is basically really hard"
"this is called fundamental atteribution"
"Your friend crashes his car: 
Situational-->bad weather
dispositional-->it was the other drivers fault he was awful"
"humans think like this: situational based on the context, or dispositional based on broad character weeps"
"high anxiety related to the powerlessness"
"are a low locus of control and a sense of powerlessness"
"sso the two vulnarabilities"
"these people tend to have an issue with feeling ""uncontrol"""
"this experiment: The  researchers got the participants to think about the global economic situation. about how they have no control over the money market, investment, ect. When people were asked do they believe in conspiracy theories, they were more likely to when fed this information intended to make them feel ""powerless"""
Okay
right
"yea dude hahahaha like if you ever want to get on an airlane again, just convince yourself the government did it so it wont happen again"
"or uncertain rather"
"is a nice alternative to an unpleasant world"
"made me laff"
"the truther theory"
"just hearing that"
"created by 9/11"
"9/11 truthers"
"high levels of anxiety"
"all these people are DOING THINGS to them"
"i.e. 9/11 truthers"
"so they think"
"ah i see"
"as far as these people are concerned they arent in control of anything"
"ohhh okay.  i definitely blame myself lol"
"Late for work---high internal locus thinks it's their own fault for eating a big breakfast, not accounting for the traffic....low internal locus of control would blame the traffic, the toaster for toasting too slow, everyone else. EXTERNALIZING the cause of the issue"
"maybe i am one of them"
"ohhhh so these people believe they totally control their lives"
"how much you think your life is in your own destiny"
"it means"
"locus of control is big"
"trevor hahahahahah"
"and blame certain groups on their problems"
"they actually are more willing to follow strong leaders"
"they have an authoritarian personality"
obviously
"they tend to be more mistrusting"
"here are some characteristics"
Yea
"so it must be"
"or it ISNT true"
"you cant say it DOESNT exist"
"you cant DISPROVE them"
like
true
HAHA
"That is the point hahaha"
"but can you prove it?"
"Obviously the president is not watching you and that car is not an FBI agent"
"With schizophrenia"
"schizophrenic delusions but less severe"
"It's like"
"they call it a ""monological belief system"""
kayz
"and I'll quote some stuff to you"

"but there is no more issue between the two or connecting the two."
"Like I'm just bored of inserting myself into your issues with chris and josh. It's the same thing over and over and I'm bored because I've said the same thing over and over. You should be bored too lol"
"tell me about your feelings about not caring because you havent really explained that to me lol"
PREDICATBLE
SOOOO
"He's SOOOOOO"
"I'm trying so hard to still care about anything josh says or does but I just caaaaannnnttt. I'm so bored with him. I don't even HAVE a theory because I am just removed haha"
"i wouldnt admit to anything"
"without prompting from me"
"martin said that too"
"to be quite honest"
"because he probably will move to VA too"
"also, that's why he is continuing to see me after i move"
"but he thinks josh is trying to replace his ex with me so he can move on with his life.  that's why he keeps showing me photos of his ex."
hahahahahaha
obviously
"but go ahead"
"no he doesn't"
"its a conspiracy"
jesus
"he has this ""all figured out"""
"here is trevor's theory"
"jesus dude"
haha
"godo thing you're moving"
HAHA
"he's almost there"
"if he looked 40 i wouldnt be interested"
"he just has days where his face does"
"dude he is!  trevor says he doesnt look old.  and he really doesnt."
haha
"but he very much looks like he's in his late 30s"
"if he was like a young, healthy looking guy in his late 30s ir wouldn't look so weird"
hahahahaha
"too late for that dude"
"he just doesnt want to look like a fucking pedophile"
haha
"im leaving"
"for josh i guess"
"that would blow"
"everyone will know"
"if he tells anyone"
-.-
"and there was only one person left"
"because i said i was not having sex with trevor"
"and he figured it out"
"psychoanalyzing me"
"i forgot he would even care, but he has been like interrogating me"
"im such an idiot"
"but dude im so upset about martin knowing"
looooooool
"HAHAHAHAHAHHAA OH MY GOD"

"you are now fedora"
"josh is a fedora and his hair is very fedora"
"i hate myself"
"so of course i bleach it and it looks like his hair"
"he and i have the same fucking hair type"
"josh's hair at its longest point"
"also, my new haircut is like"
"but hoped he wouldnt"
"which i knew he would"
"martin figured out im hooking up with josh"
"a fucking frenzy"
"i know dude it's so weird.  the reason being is everyone at TM has wanted to have sex with me for 2 years, and now im single, and there's literally a frenzy dude"
hahaha
"you are literally DECIDING among CHOICES"
"I miss having sex with anyone. You're like deciding who to have sex with, and I have the choice of no one hahaha"
"so, i think he understands"
"okay, that's sort of what i was thinking.  but like, it wasnt uncomfortable.  he didnt start with the ""i love yous"" or anything.  and afterwards we just went to sleep."
"You can. It's no ethical problem. IF you can keep from getting too emotionally involved and he can as well. Which I question. It's a little too raw right now for that I think"
"Here's the thing."
"i dont know"
"should i do that?"
but
"too fine with it, and now he thinks we can just have sex whenever"
ok
"okay so, chris has gotten over himself totally and is fine with the idea of us just living together as we always have"
"tell me"
"help meh for a sec"

"and now he is trying to play games too"
"i made the mistake of telling him i got into his head"
"but jesus lol"
"i guess someone technically COULD ask him to go do something before the end of the day"
"because i know he's lying"
"it irritates me"
like
"i know dude"
LIAR
"he has no life"
idiot
"and of course he said ""im not sure, i may have plans, ill let you know"""
hahaha
"this morning i was just like, hey, let me know if we're hanging out later because im not going to talk to you during work"
"i'd let him too"
yeah

"so im letting him"
"and trying to be distant"

lolol
"USE THEM ALL"
"forget all this drama"
"yes true"
haha
"you can use all you can get"
"who cares"
"and it would be awkward"
"but chris knows"
"no, he would help"
"enough to be a bad friend and not help"
"im helping trevor move sunday, and he specifically told me he doesnt want chris to help hahaha"
"he hates chris"
"or not"
"i may have trevor help too"
"hahaha well im glad someone there will be"
"I am not #strong"
"I am a pro at moving. I have done it about 11 times. I helped kelleys dad move yesterday. I am very #efficient and #strong"
"okay we may enlist your assistance then lol.  we have to come back to chas after we get down there anyways"
"so If it's not ON the 15th I can help you move"
"because we have no house right now"
"just the moving part im worried about"
"but I am going to cbus on the 15th but I'm coming back"
"i know dude im really excited about that part"
"which will be worlds of helpfullness"
"you'll still have a slightly larger income"
"i mean look at it this way"
"we would be getting a condo now, but kendall has no money and is a shit person"
"well our last day here is the 15th but i dont know what day we're moving, we are still working on getting a shitty little apartment rented so we can save uip and get a nice condo after a few months"
"what is the date your'e moving again? I really wish I could help"
"bvut i am at the same time"
"I know :/"
"im NOT happy about moving -.-"
"i have to either pay 230 to geta  hitch put on my car, or used my dad's van, and then drive it back up here after i unpack"
"HAHA yea dude i know those feels"
"but i must"
"or use it to live"
"It's at such a nice amount in the bank that I don't want to touch it"

"otherwise ill miss out on our last food, and i need to pick up clothes from my mom, plus my gas is on E and i have no money"
"actually i have to go home, fuck.  im sorry."
"my mom is scaring me at this point so im definitely coming over after work haha, then at somer point i have to go by her house and pick up the bullshit she NEEDS to give me"
"thats fucking hilarious"
"but seriously"
"i was like NOOOOOOO thats so sad"

hahahahaha
"Hashtag f"

"that said"
"i saw this thing"
"jesus lolol"
"A #bold one"
"over the years"
"it's just a conclusion ive come to"
"That was really #bold"
"and thats really upsetting"
"i wont be free until she is dead"
"for what she has done to me"
"i will always resent her"
"So weird"
"That's super odd"
"I HATE HER"
"instead of typing"
"she just sent me a fuckin 9 second long voice message"
"im afraid of being consumed"
"i cant have relationships"
"she is the reason"
"yes it is dude"
"That's scary"
inside
insnide
"this woman is killing me"
"so when i ask her to stop sending them, she decides to send even more"
"Oh my haha"
"she sent one too many photos"
"just sort of snapped on my mom"
"chris is kind of like, we can be as connected and close as you feel comfortable with"
"Good thinking"
"because i think i may be too codependent to live on my own"
"but i want to go to therapy first"
"Right now, we are going to have to get a 2 bedroom when we move because that's all we can afford, until we get some paychecks.  and that means if i want, i can move out into my own place."
"Trapped sounds accurate"
"I don't know what happened."
"I don't know dude, I almost feel like I just got bored?  Also I felt trapped."
"Maybe. Or maybe it's just a simple as you don't like closeness. It's uncomfortable"
"and i think i figured out a large part of my mental issues just a minute ago. my mom has been sending me photos of stuff i made as  a kid in school with weird captions about how much she loves me, and its making me violently disgusted.  i think  my reaction to people who love me is to push them away if i feel they get too close, because i dont want to be owned by them like she owned me."
GOOD
Also
HOOD
"chris is being totally normal and actually helping me somewhat."
hahaha
"Hesk dell"
"dude, its almost time for me to escape this desk hell"
"that's weirdly irresponsible of him? or is it? haha"
Stopped
"I'm going to say it is probably also dehydrated because he doesn't have a proper misting system."
"He just"
"That's the thing"
"He hasnt"
"how often?"
"was he giving it calcium?"
"i mean"
"hahaha jesus"
"Like how could I assume matt would kill it"
"My mom got all god damn defensive when I said I wasn't shocked"
"It's dying of a calcium deficiency"
"dude...you guys have got to stop getting chameleons.  if i cant handle one, matt probably cant either lol"
"The chameleon is dying in from of me..its very sad lol"
"im just adjusting to being ""alone"""
"im okay i think"
"maybe.  if all goes well i sold 300 dollars ingeckos but i have to get confirmation and even then the people could drop out before they meet me."
"That's good. Any gecko buyers?"
"just bad nerves"
"im pretty okay"
"Any better?"
"How are you doing dude?"
"it's okay. Don't worry about it. Just try and relax. I know that's impossible but try and let your mind drift to other things"
"Sorry for the drama"
Okay
"It gives me anxiety attacks"
"I can be your friend and support you, but I literally have exhausted myself emotionally trying to help you work these things out. I'm not being mean, I just don't have the ability to keep up with the drama dude"
"Doesn't look like anyone is. I guess I'll just be getting over myself then."
lol
"I am not going to be a part of this"
"I am not on anyone's side"
"So you can't be on my side loil"
"except I actually told him what was happening"
"I mean, I guess you went threough what Chris did"
"Not sure what to say"
"Just at a loss for words today"
"I mean okay"
"i have no one"
"dude like, if you feel better, please talk to me lol"
"if i can do that, i will be calmer"
"about to make 500 in sales"
"i think im selling some geckos today"
"but i guess technically some of them are his so we would have to split them up or something."
"trevor says i need my own gecko bank account because chris doesnt do any work on them and still shares the money i make"
"im selling geckos"
"CVhris and I are the only ones working on it, I don't think you understand how much money we need to even be accepted"
"Have none of you looked?"
"at least, for now"
"it's for me and kendall and chris"
"it's not just for me though"
Chill
"I'll help you find a house"
"Don't waste anymore money on anything. Just save save save"
"we dont have a house picked out and i need to sell a shit ton of geckos"
"i am so depressed"
"i had to overdraft my account for gas this morning"
"why do i feel so bad"
"help me"
Noooo
"wallow in misery with me"
"but dude"
"so he sort of got fired"
"he got too many occurences and told them he was leaving at the same time that they wanted him gone lol"
"What did he do"
What
"im so lonely D:"
"the point being that he's gone"
"dude trevor got fired sort of"
"Just to keep my mind clear"
"I have to stay out of the house"
"Thank you. I'm a half wreck right now."
Sure
"Can we pretty please hang out after work?"
"Yep probably is then. Dude Chris woke up and told me he loved me and went back to sleep. I can't stop crying."
"It totally looks like MBD"
"He's done this lol"
"Dude I don't know what to do I have work D:"
"it looks like it has a broken leg"
"it is at like the bottom of the cage"
"I CANT DEAL WITH THIS"
"text him and help him 304-546-9208"
"jesus fuck"
"matts god damn stupid chameleon is dying again"
help
"Oh god yasssss"
MMMMMM
"A forest,  live"
"So enjoying the cure right now"
"Which is valid"
"Josh is trying to replace jeni with me"
"He also says"
"Hahaha yes"
"But lazy, no"
"Trevor is just as weird haha"
Wondeful
"He keeps saying Chris is ""lazy and weird"""
"Trevor helped me so much with residual issues"
"Dude I'm so satisfied"
"So appropriate"
"Is playing"
"Hold me down by MCS"
Good
"It feels peaceful."
"Does it honestly feel that much different?"
"How are the both of you?"
"That's true."
"Because everyone involved would be upset"
"I see."
"oh ok."
"We don't want our families to know"
"I know but the last part?"
"We are done. As in single. Broken up."
Hm?
"It's done. We will pretend for the sake of looks, for now."
Great.
"I did it. Still talking it out but I think he understands."
but
"it will be awful"
"It will be"
"You guys are both telling me that if the situation is unstable, leave. But Jesus it will be such a mess."
To
"Or, the replicate josh"
"He's changed his habits so much to fit mine"
"I guess you're right. I'm just so scared."
"sometimes things just don't work exactly right"
"if it does it does"
"Let your life unfold"
"stop thinking of everyone else"
"Right. Josh told me to break it off if it feels unstable but I told him I don't want to jeopardize him"
"i don't think he will"
"the you'll call the cops, because you're not gonna let him hurt himself or anyone else"
"Tell him if he makes a threat like that"
"If he even thinks of doing it"
"I know this. My main fear is that he will just go crazy and kill himself or like, have an episode and try to kill josh. He's talked about blowing his car up and beating the shit out of him. Chris would lose, but still."
"you have to be decisive"
"but you know you have to do .... something"
"It will take longer than you want"
"I know."
"You're right but I am afraid of what he would do."
"In my opinion"
"If the ultimate decision is about your relationship, it should be about you."
"Are they though?"
"Here's something I just found. This is a really common criticism of your decision making process lately: 

Problem: the rights of an individual are less important 
than the good for the many, for utilitarianism."
Good.
"Hm...these types of ideas help me, there's always a pattern you can explain"
"Your choices at the moment demonstrate why it's contraversial."
"This is an ideology that's received a lot of criticism."
"Here's what you're doing. You're being Utilitarian. It's that old concept in ethics that says ""devote your resources to saving what generates maximum output."" In other words your  happiness is represented by a guy in a burning building. Your life with chris is represented by 10 guys in another burning building. You keep choosing to save the 10 guys."
"Our animals will be neglected"
"I'll have to leave"
"If I break up with him there will be a fight"
"He will stop trying to help me"
"ok that's something."
"I know if I try it will just get worse"
"because you've passed all of the gates that asked the tough questions"
"am I happy"
"is this working"
"it's just about a yes or no question"
"this has stopped being about time invested, rationality, expectations"
"Which I tried to explain"
"And neither will I."
"I know :/"
"The one thing you should remember or take from this at all is the fact that ""people don't change"""
"It has been."
"That's something Iv'e recently learned on several occasions"
"I was hoping he would get over himself but its been a long time now"
"sometimes that means nothing"
"I don't know...I've invested so much time and effort...."
"This is what it's starting to feel like dude"
"Do you love him enough to chain yourself down and lay in your own misery, only so he doesn't feel bad about himself?"
"I'm so flakey"
"I was so dumb to think I could stay with anyone"
"Chris was the one I thought I would always love. I have loved him since I was a kid. Maybe even my first love."
"i dunnno"
"i guess?"
"What seems fun inititally isn't always good for you"
"Stop surrounding yourself with such horrible people if they're gonna do these things to you. Obviously you don't think highly of chris. You keep getting into relationships where people are clearly immature, and will ultimately hurt you. Just End this one (If you want) or correct what's happenign and move on? I dunno. If you end it it will be a lesson that can be transcribed to future relationships: just because someone is interesting or seems liek a project doesn't mean you should actually pursue them"
like
"you're always going into detail on day to day things and I don't know if it's overreaction or if every day is really that difficult"
"He didn't have to, he just went to josh and almost got in a fight with him at work after I begged him not to"
"So chris has blackmailed you before"
"I'm making assumptions based on history"
"Because you'll never make a proper decision"
"That is problematic."
"You're making decisions based on assumptions."
"You aren't."
"I'm trapped either way."
"You have two choices."
"then don't do it."
"Yea I want to but I don't want to freak josh out and I don't want anyone in my family to freak out. Chris could blackmail me and josh too."
"this is excruciating to watch"
"but like"
"I'm not saying you're done for good"
"you at least need a break from the obligation that goes along with being in a relationship officially"
"you are beating a dead horse"
"it's jsut one thing after another"
"You are in constant misery"
"End it with chris and rip off the bandage for now. Just stay plutonic. You have to get to virginia with him. There's no way around that. Life is super hard, and chris may not know how to deal with that but he's who you have in this present moment. Try and work with it."
"My suggestion is this"
"I just don't know what to do with my life.  Of course I want to be with someone I love to help me get through all of my obstacles but Chris is killing me inside"
"or if you want feedback"
"I don't know if you want to vent"
"well you're talking to me"
okay
"Yea right"
"""Talk to josh"""
"That's it"
"""That's not true, you have friends """
"He's not saying much if anything"
"And Trevor if he even counts"
"what is he saying"
"I have a sick friend, and FWB that doesn't want me around"
"yes I'm crying and saying how at least he has friends that care about him when he's upset"
"or are you just waiting for him to pick up on it"
"are you clearly upset"
"Because if he did he would try to comfort me or SOMETHING"
"that's not real dude"
like
"or he would be...."
"that is just something you made up"
"You're saying chris doesn't love me because...."
"I hate Chris"
"I can't smoke or take my medication"
"I can't function"
"Which is understanadble"
"such is life dude. You don't want to die. You jsut don't want to do this."
"I'm so fucked. I have to sell my favorite animals just so I'm not homeless. Chris doesn't love me or he would be able to comfort me.  And josh probably just doesn't care."
what

"he isnt changing his mind at this point, about ANYTHING"
YEp
"he understands it all"
"even though he pretends to be someone else"
"he knows who he is"
"i like that i have someone who is stable"
"you'll always be adapting to him"
"because he's not young enough to make major changes in his life"
"I think he will always be one"
however
"you like projects"
"knowing you, if he's no longer a project you will no longer be with him"
"""ethics"""
"i dont know where the line is"
"at what point is he no longer a project? will he always be one?"
"thank you so much"
"Ethics are all relative anyway"
"don't get fixated on the ethics of it"
"if it makes you happy just do it"
"is your life is up to you you know."
"So what I'm saying"
"However, you know him and get that."
"I mean granted, I think it's super weird because he is literally a project and the challenge of it doesn't seem worth it to me."
"No. You aren't."
"am i wrong for enjoying it the way i do?"
"so do you think what i have going on with josh is wrong?"
"hahaha exactlyyyyyyyyyyYYYyyy"
"he is never going to ask to marry me lolol"
"of course i would still come visit josh just because he doesnt expect anything from me"
"dude....im starting to really see clearly now and like i have been saying, maybe when i get to VA i just dont need to be in any relationship"
"but yeah i remember that"
"it's like the WORST master plan EVER"
"that you love him so much and worship him that you DEFINITELY would keep it"
"which also assumes"
"he tried to make sure you would have his child"
"to keep you"
"hate to get all social justice on you but that's some patriarchal bull shit"
jesus
"THAT WAS AFTER THE INITIAL JOSH THING"
"AND YOU KNOW WHAT"
"he didnt trick me as much as manipulated me"
"and then i had an abortion"
"into getting pregnant"
"he actually tricked me"
"i know D:  i guess maybe thats why i need to get out some, because he is suffocating me with wanting a family and shit dude"
"just be happy"
"why does there have to be A SINGULAR GOAL"
like
"but don't make it THE goal"
"like marriage is nice if at some point you both wanted it"
SERIOUSLY
"i dont get it"
"where did these christian values come from"
"i keep asking him"
"old fashioned"
"he shouldn't be so"
"he is too technically"
"like we are millennials"
RIGHT
"everything has to be set ins tone for him to be comfortable"
"is he like 35"
"why is marriage the end game for him"
"because he is not a flowing person"
"why does it have to be about marriage"
"and he has been talking about liking talking to alexis about hsit i hate"
"oh no"
"he isnt sure im the person he will marry"
"chris told me"
"im very torn now because"
"i dont know =/"
"dude like"
HAHA
hhaahhaaha
"i also took a couple ativan"
hahahahahaha
"wow dude that was really accurate.  you are very high."
"*He represents you*"
"the dichotomy of hunder and josh is an ethereal faceless man with a heart made out of passive aggressive love"
"and chris was talking about how his ex that he's been talking to and getting with talks to him about korn and bullshit i dont care about, and he loves it"
"not all of them but similarly"
"i should have remembered that we have all of the same interests"
"its not like i went into this looking to start a relationship with anyone, ive just always been attracted to josh"
"it makes me happy"
"i dont care if that's what it is"
HAHAHAHA
"IT IS WHAT IT IS"
"i dont want to call it anything"
"but that's what it is due"
"i dont need to call it anything"
"i mean, he would not let me call it that lol"
lol
"that sounds like a relationship"
"when i get to his house, he cuddles and kisses me for quite awhile before anything even happens.  he holds me and plays with my hair.  he appreciates me as a person and not just a sex object."
"yes go for it"
lol
"of course i can"
"can i be totally honest with you?"
"he has started changing how he is around me"
"help me understand lol"
"what do you mean?"
"you're sly"
"I feel like he would have made adjustments to himself"
"i don't know"
"he is a libra so im sure he can see through me pretty well too"
"i didnt tell him until later but the fact that he picke dup on it was weird"
"and kept asking what was wrong"
"and he actually picvked up on that"
"i was upset about the way we had been talking recently"
"well you know, he changes a lot when im around him.  he becomes nurturing and kind.  of course he doesnt change his core beliefs, he will still argue with me if he disagrees, but he is understanding and is genuinely interested in what i have to say"
hahaha
"and be human beings"
"there's no reason to act so weird"
"oh wait"
"or because"
"just because he's afraid"
"or try to act like im expecting too much alreadfy"
"he would either identify and say the same"
"i would tell josh that too but, i dont know how he would react"
"I know :/"
"and im gonna miss that a lot"
"hes fun to be around"
"he's just such a nice person and he sings with me and takes me to get food, wont let me buy anything"
lol
"I mean I don't get it but i believe you"
"that is realllllyy clear"
haha
"i know he acts differently online"
"you would not believe how similarly we act in closed settings"
lolol
"we are the same person"
"also, he's a libra so like"
"he doesnt judge me"
"and comfort"
understanding
"its just"
"but i would never call it love"
"if im being completely honest with you, josh and i definitely have a connection of some sort and i really do enjoy being around him.  you can love people without wanting to date or marry them.  friends love each other all the time."
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"""we don't have to talk because *eyes shimmer* we can just sit there and *enjoy* eachothers sweet sweet #company*"
"the other way is like"
"""we don't have to talk because we are fucking"""
"it's like"
"one way"
"either way it's weird"
"but when i try talking to him online, he's not the same"
"when we are together, we enjoy each other so much, because we dont have to talk at all (not saying that in a weird way)"
"yes you do"
"josh and i have a weird relationship"
"i dont know"
"of course i will but"
"Will you still talk to him"
"good idea"

"i cant tell chris that but"
"im going to miss josh =/"
"of course not"
"Yeah it will be rough"

"he was like, im a fucking idiot"
hahahaha
"he is so regretting that car"
dude
"he thinks hes poor"
"but he makes enough as a supervisor I'm sure"
"like he's not rich"
"why can't he move out?"
"but im like YOU MAKE MORE MONEY THAN ME THIS MAKES NO SENSE"
"and why he cant move out"
"and what he pays on his car"
"all of his bills"
"he told me"
"yes dude like"
"the fuck"
"just a basement?"
"that's all it is?"
"I THOUGHT HE WAS EXAGGERATING"
"LIKE A TRUE BASEMENT"
"IS A BASEMENT"
"""house"""
"his house"
"dude oh god"
hahahahaha
"i can read\"
"that everything he does"
"i told him last night"
"but i can read him"
lolol
"miss him extra hard or something"
"i think he wants me to liker"
"but i dont think hes doing it because he IS distant"
"which is good though"
"so now he is going to be totally distant again, like normal"
"he maybe regrets that"
"and i think"
"josh has effectively showed me his feels"
"i see whats happening now"
"dude like"
right
"but it's something new"
"he doesn't have to like it just because you do"
"He may as well give it a try"
awhile
"io think hes actually signing on to have sex with his ex for ahwile though"
"you can't put anyone else before yourself"
"yes exactly, great advice and yea i agree"
"but he also needs to figure out what his ""josh"" is, like whatever it is that he needs"
"so you can be happy in your relationship so as long as chris can be"
"You figured out how to be happy individually"
"You guys focus so much on your relationship as a whole, rather than on your individual happiness that your relationship takes turns for the worse. A happy relationship needs to have two happy individuals to function as a unit. It never works when there's a dichotomy of emotion."
what?
"I told him something I've told you"
"we just talked about everything"
"it was so comfortable"
"i know"
good
"i guess"
"and he is serious about his FWB"
"now okay with the idea"
"he seems like"
"i think you may have dude"
"I did."
"he said you tried to help him"
"he told me he talked to you some"
"I talked to him yesterday.  do NOT tell him I told you, but we had a very good talk. That's al lI'm gonna say about it out of respect for him"
"chris is maturing?"
"i mean, i have big bruises but theyre not excessive,  but i have on around my neck and a huge bite bruise on my arm that were accidents sort of lol but chris was like ""im not upset, i thought he would have torn you apart, just ask him to go easier with bruises next time.  i know you like bdsm sometimes so as long as your safe it's fine but the bruises are bad"""
"sexual energy of some sort"
"I thought that mayu have been like"
"Then he's just a big baby omg hahaha"
but
"chris was expecting me to be beaten to hell"
now
"no not really actually, which is good"
"he is submissive in bed too I bet. Even though he'd like you to believe it's the other way around?"
"I HAVE CONTROL"
hahahahahaha
"why didnt i let this happen sooner"
dude
"OH NO"
"and ssaying"
profusely
"thanking me"

"and I didn't htink it would be"
"He already kind of has. We're talking about it. hahahaha"
"but i didnt really care"
"the sex was not great for me"
"i plan on continuing to do it because he's fun"
"well im moving soon so lol.  but theres nothing complicated about it unless he makes it complicated."
"That can get really complicated really fast"
"Okay, and you're okay with this? You want to continue on with this? Well specifically with HIM in this way?"
"you cant mistake that"
"was love"
"the look on his face"
like
"yes, he is dude"

"holds my hand when hes driving, but not enough for it to be over bearing"
"he like"
"i didnt either dude"
"that's like weird-cute. That's not what I imagined this as"
"was singing songs with me on the radio"
"and like"
"he wanted me to shower with him (which was not weird at all, nothing happened, just soap), and then he drove me to scott depot and bought me food at sheetz"
hahahaha
"OH NOOOOOOOOOO"
"and then like"
"OH NO"
"saying everything BUT ""i love you"""
"OH NO"
"and was like"
"he was over excited to cuddle"
"okay ill just tell you"
hahaha
"he said"
"dude like"
"but yeah dude I'm not super surprised"
HAHA
"yeah that's not...that's weird. What's that about. did you marry him"
"im not doing that shit lol"
"calling me baby a few times"
"and like"
"he immediately began treated me like a coveted object"
"what happened was"

"because i make fun of him"
"he says it means it reinforces that i have no feelings for him"
"i think that helps him"
"he has started making fun of josh with me"
"he is slowly accepting it"
"Don't take that as approval. He doesn't approve haha. But it's a step in the right direction"
"and i told him if it wasnt josh, it would have been someone else"

"there shouldnt be wreckage"
"i mean"

"and not have to deal with the wreckage"
"that i can TRULY study"
"a specimen"
"hes like"
"i dont know dude, i think he's pretty attractive and i like fucking with people"
"I'm sorry"
Hahahahaha
"Jesus fuck"

"Dude what do you see in this"

"im sorry but that is so fucking pathetic"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"bought dick pills"
"wait for it"
"he went to the adult book store in jefferson"
Ok
"i want to tell you something hilarious"
"josh has settled down"
Yeah
"obviously not happening"
"and if emotions evolve, i have to tell him"
"and not talk about details"
"he just wants me to be safe"
"and he wants to have me in his life even if i need to have things he doesnt understand"
"no really, it got SO bad, that he completely turned around and i was so non-lenient with him, and i kept so strong, that he finally realized he had chosen to leave me because he couldnt accept me"
"I just don't think he's being genuine. He doesn't think this is an okay thing to do. He's forcing himself to try and make this work. Are you okay with that?"
"but he just made that rule in case, so he could level the playing field"
"he will never have one"
"i get 1 FWB, he gets 1 FWB"
"but we have come to terms"
"i will do what i want"
"i told him that i am free"
"i told him no more lies whatsoever, i am being honest 100% of the time but i dont want him snooping in my shit"
"If you're okay with that."
"he is no longer allowed to bug me, he cant access my personal accounts"
"and is okay with me being with josh on occasion"
"chris gave in"
so
"He's insane"
"I need to go somewhere"
Dude
"well thats not so weird"
oh
"He was talking to the geckos"
"check on him"
what
"He sounds insaneb"
"Chris is talking to himself upstairs..."
"I'm here."
Yep.
"see you in like 30?"
"because i know he will"
"going home now i guess...cant wait to have him yelling at me in the car about josh having sex with me"
"i wish chris would shut up"
"and upset"
"im not stoned im just like shaking and anxious"
"Gauges gauges"
"Typing typing"
"Fuck phone typing"
"Also Also in sorry"
"i feel cold and weak"
"Not what I meant. You just started randomly saying things like you were stoned"
"so that sucks"
"i regained my appetite last night, ate a bunch of food, and lost it again today"
"i have no food or water"
no
"Did you take something hahahahaha"
"and for real my spasms are coming back from stress"
"u will laff a lot"
"iz a funny 1"
"oh i have a funny jopke to tell you"
haha
"IM SO COLD"
"because IM JUST A HUMAN BEING WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME"
"that shouldnt even be fucked"
"about this fucked up shit"
"so i could talk to him in person more"
"i really fucking wish josh had a normal woprk schedule"
"oh i didnt know that was confirmed.  yes pls lol"
"I told you I would pick you up after you got home if you wanted"
"i have PAWS"
"im getting chills from stress"
"I know"
"and no one cuold bitch"
"and i could just sit and be alone"
"where it was like this never happened today"
"i wish i could go somewhere after work"
"god dammit"
"and im just crying"
"i have Linger by the cranberries stuck in my head"
"i HAVE to do what they say"
"as long as i have a parent or partner, im not in control of my life"
"and i had a car, but could only drive it certain places"
"and then i had BFs"
"i had mom"
"i have always had someone watching me"
"He has to see what's happening"
"i have never been free"
"that i have literally been a human slave my whole life"
"im trying to explain to him"
"im doing both....he is fighting it all"
"Acknowledgement is one thing. Acceptance is totally different"
"Sometimes it's just this weird chemical thing. Life tricks you into thinking you're meant to be with someone and doesn't reveal that it isn't true until years later when it's a real challenge to TRULY accept"
"I forced bella into some major life changes, and we're still not together...even though she seems more ""ideal"" now and ""sensible"""
"I know. Part of you doesn't even want to accept it. It just wants to continue fighting in circles, because that's easier than accepting the reality of it"
"he just isnt success oriented"
"but i dont want to tell him that"
"i dont think he and i belong together in the long run"
"No. but if you feel guilt or are having second thoughts don't look for confirmation, just act on it. I see it like this...what you want is just fine if it's agreed upon by both people in the relationship. If two people want different things they don't need to be together. I will lie for you (obviously) and I don't have any kind of ""moral"" objection to what you're doing. However, if I were in chris ' s position I would be very hurt and confused. I wouldn't know what to do."
"because if it is, i dont want to do it"
"is what im doing ""fucking deplorable""?"
"that i just wanna ive the zef life man"
"why doesnt chris understand"
"i get what you're saying"
"but not his way of being at this moment"
"i love chris"
"and then when he gets down there, if he can act like a god damned man, start to learn hwo to dress, and become a bit more seasoned, ill probably just get back with him"
"like his mom would i guess"
"he is coming to VA beach still because im making him"
"he and i are broken up"
"no, this is what is happening"
"you're gambling"
chance
"so this is like"
"which isn't REALLY going to happen"

"WHAT DO I DO"
"SHE NOTICED IM SWEATY"
"OH MY GOD"
"and he looked like"

"that's awful"

"i don't think"
"and that's not the biggest part of life"
"other than my career"
lol
"in life"
"i don't even know what I want"
"I'm going to make money, breed geckos, and get an awesome house. Anything that isn't related to those things can fuck off."
"who does"
"i suppose not lol"
"Well shit I don't care anymore"
hahahaha!
"And I said, thank you hahahaha"
"don't take pride in that lol"
"Because I was so sneaky"
"Dude Chris congratulated me on how sneaky I was."
"I am legend"
"HAHAHA what why"
"My sister just came downstairs fuming because my mom is taking a nap. Also she was wearing my shirt lol"
"One of Josh's best qualities is that he does what he wants and because he wants to"
"And josh blew him off, which I would have LOVE to have seen"
"I can't believe he tried to talk to josh"
"You should talk to him dude hahahaha"
"WORST WAY"
"He is being a child"
MOOOOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
"That makes me want to vomit"
"It disturbs me. ""When you get back home after having josh inside you"""
"That's the worst phrase of all time"
"In what context"
"What the hell"
"That's what I'm saying. Accept what has happened and move the fuck on or at least shut up about it. He keeps trying to use to phrase ""inside of you"" to make me sound as depraved as possible for what I've done"
"Why is this a big deal. Why would he have to sneak"
"Chris took lunch without me and I just saw him sneak past me to get back in the building"
Okay
"im about to go on lunch without chris so i need you to try to talk to me for 30 minutes so i dont look like aloser hahaha"
"this is so odd and different"
hahahahaha
"it probably isnt that bad"
"but if you do what he says"
"or you might get smacked"
"like, do what he says"
"but he is VERY forceful"
"he doesnt actually really hurt me"
like
christ
"after enough bitching he finally allowed me to walk us back to my car"
"OMG HAHAHAHA OMG"
"they are looking!"
"and im like, it looks like im about to get raped!"
"and he's like, theyre not looking"
"i kept saying, no, theres people there"
hahahahahahaha
"but it was weird and fun"
IMINPUBLIC
WHATISTHIS
WHATHAVEIDONE
OHGODOHGODOHGOD
"im like"
"well yea it was weird, he was EXPLAINING that sometimes he does it without warning, two seconds later he grabs my vape, sets it on the ground, grabs my neck pulls it over to his face and forces his tongue into my mouth"
"""DONT TOUCH MY NECK"""
"Oh god I'd hate that"
"Especially without warning"
"lemme breath pls"
"dont grab my neck pls"
like
"i dont hate it but i guess ill put up with it hAHAHAHA"
Hahahahahahaha
"i dont really like it"
"because i didnt sign up for that"
"we're gonna have a problem"
"if josh starts mixing our friend talks with his weird bdsm shit"
"now like"
hahaha
"thats all im sure of"
"is my body"
"the only thing that is even real"
basically
"EVERYTHING IS INVALID"
Like
So
"I am biased lol. But so is he in theory"
"so he gives up trying to talk to you"
"he said that you tell him youre my best friend and that youre biased"
"I mean I've tried to talk to him about this stuff before"
"he does not cut it with that shit"
"but he doesnt"
"im just like, maaaan, cut it with that shit"
"and then says repeatedly how the waiting is ""healthy"", or it's a part of the plan, or whatever"
"what other dude purposefully waits longer than necessary for sex?"
hahahaha
"ruin it all"
"and i want to just"
"because now he really is trying to seem super mysterious and like he has amaster plan"
"so now i need to step it up"
"also josh has started playing mind games with me"
"why is that a fucking crime"
"i just want to live life while im alive"
"bt thats all i can think of"
"he doesnt want to listen because youre biased i guess"
"assure him that i will get bored and come back to him IF he improves his image and work ethic"
"tell him the dissected version of what im doing"
"i feel like maybe you should talk to chris because you can dissect me"
"i mean, he's making me feel like shit because he feels like shit about being shit"
Damn
"all of this"
"over just"
"okay because im crying lol"
"Yea possibly"
"i dont want chris AND you in the same car"
"i have to go to my dads for a few but thats it"
"i wish i was lol, can you come pick me up or something later?"
"I'm off now"
"think and talk"
"to just"
"so when do you get off work? i need some time with a friend"
"That's awful.  Ah"
"over pointless points..."
"still arguing with him...."
"because he made me be his mother"
"told him im not IN love with him right now"
"i basically am not hlding punches"
"and doesnt have good hygiene"
"and that he acts ike akid"
"im telling him im tired of being the mom"
"no it isnt"
"I don't think that's EXACTLY it"
Hm
"""Chris Kingery:  
You just want to be different. 2:55 PM

"""
"or i will die"
"i need it"
"but i like super fucking weird"
"just saying"
"he's like, super fucking weird"
"Yeah hahaha"
hahahaha
"grimey sometimes"
"hes so fucking"
"(although josh wants me to)"
"i dont have to lie about where im going anymore"
"and chris is dealing with it"
"and everything is still good on the josh front"
"well, josh is on out of work speaking terms lol"
"i am utterly amazed that josh AND chris are still on speaking terms with me"
"That's something"
"But he's willing to try for you"
"You just have to understand what you're asking"
"gotta give it a try"
"but i might not"
hahahahahahaha
"i predict i will hook up with josh and be like, wow that was lame, hes an asshole"
"and honestly"
"i think everything is fine"
"he wants to move to VA still and everything"
"it is"
"See at least chris cards enough about you and your relationship to make a sacrifice. It's just a strange and confusing one for Him"
"and now i cant talk to him at work"
"no more work conversations"
"josh said, your boy just came over here trying to talk with me"
"he cost me talking to josh at work"
"i know"
"i know dude"
"See that's not appropriate he doesn't quite get it yet haha"
hahahahahaha
"and josh refused"
"he tried to talk to josh about it"
"with the fact that i want to do what i want"
"he has come to terms"
"How so"
O.O
"chris came to terms"
woah
"im a manipulater"
"gah i shouldnt be so good at lying"
"skillfully, ill say"
"so, i saved that"
"and he told me to message him later"
"josh is okay"
"but it appears"
"because im at work"
"i have to do some work"
"SHELL NEVER BURN PLASTIC AGAIN"
"And removed her door knob and closed her door"
"I dead bolted her out"
"I like lost my shit"
Haha
"I faced consequence"
HAHAHAHAHA
"I KNEW SHE HEARD US"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Lol
"That would be great. I can't be at home. Had to lock maria out last night. Her and her posse locked me out for 30 minutes after you dropped me off, despite my pleading. All because we laughed at her reaction to my mom working."
"you can come lol"
but
"i have to go to my dads after work"
"wait shit"
"misery fest after work? lol"
"aw D:"
"My life is a mess"
"I'm wallowing in misery and drinking every day"
"I need a clean break of sorts too"
"just me, my geckos, and the open world"
"im just waiting for the clean break"
"im not worried much"
"dude i know"
"It probably won't"
"Not saying I hope it does"
Haha
"There are 200000 better joshs in VA"
"If it goes badly with josh"
"I just need you to know something"
"if i lie to josh, he will never trust me"
"thats what i did claim hahaha"
"That's not a huge lie that's just a bending of of the truth that could easily be covered up by claiming chris automatically assumed that because of his intense reaction"
"josh will think he just assumes it dead on"
"so in case chris yells at him about it"
"i told josh that chris ""assumed"" that is the case"
"i told chris that josh and i had planned on having sex before i left"
"What is it"
"he will be very upset about"
"that is josh finds out about"
"Maybe a little?"
"is there is ONE lie"
"the only thing im afraid of"
"so far josh has not totally lost his shit"
"have i done the same to chris?"
"Because its a hilarious situation to where she has actually chosen to be with the opposite of me."
HAHAHAHA
HAHAHA
"I call him dui"
"No he does"
"she has a dui?!"
"She is at a house with no service with DUI"
"Nope I just realized"
"she is not dead"
hahaha
dude
"On a lighter note. I haven't spoken to bella in 24 hours, and she has literally been on the Internet 0 times. She may be dead."
"Yikes. .."
"hes going to do it at work"
"chris is going to accuse him of trying to sneak around with me"
"but now im worried"
"it is"
"That's weird haha"
lololol
"to see if he should"
"i guess to gauge how much i give a shit"
"he asked me what he had for lunch yesterday"
"i guess because chris didnt learn of any devastating details, josh seems pretty okay"
and
"well im talking to him now"
"Why would he do that?"
"Because what if he flips shit and won't talk to me again"
Why?
"I'm worried"
"Josh is still not awake"
"He is so valuable to me but what has to be done has to be done"
"I hope that works out then"
"I will have to sell a few more geckos that normally I would never ever sell. If I can sell one of them for 1k, which I think I can, I would be good"
"All I know is you have to get out of here lol"
"He doesn't have the money. He makes 300 dollar checks."
"But so once you leave is chris leaving too or is he not probably?"
"OH NO haha"
Lol
"I have to take a shower now, brb. Keep affirming my actions please"
"If he left"
"Hey you know what would be awesome"
"I hope I can pack and move everything by myself"
"Kendall is going to freak out"
"I'll sell some more stuff lol"
"Not a huge problem"
"The only problem now is VA beach"
"Fuck it"
"I don't"
"Who even cares dude. Don't let yourself care"
"Yep. I guess it's good that by the time everyone knows I'm the whore, I'll be gone"
"""It must be joshs fault"""
"He'd rather  reject the idea that you chose to do this"
"I know"
But
"He needs to talk to you"
"That's not good"
"Can't end well"
"He wants to talk to josh about it in person apparently"
"I just can believe he want so crazy. I kept saying, let's be reasonable and not ruin our lives here"
"Well you know you always have it"
"Because I'm scared"
"I'm officially relying heavily on you for support"
"I think it's time he felt some sorrow for it"
"Chris has done this same shit to every one of his GFs"
Also
Yea
"Or josh wouldn't really be an issue anyway"
"The issue is much deeper than that obviously"
"Josh isn't the issue"
"I mean, he didn't have much to do with the big picture problem"
"I get that"
"I'm afraid of what he will say"
"Josh still hasn't woken up"
"I'm 20"
"I don't really want or need to be tied down at this point in life"
"I know!"
"I mean i get his frustration but I get yours too. The truth is, you don't want the same thing"
"He can't come to terms. He said we can't have a family together this way. I told him he is letting his closed mind ruin everything."
"Idk dude"
Bu
"That would not be my response"
No
"I mean that would be my response. Of course I'm on your side, but I get why he's upset. I just don't get why he didn't already come to terms with it."
"Was talking at a million miles a minute having a breakdown"
"Told me to fuck off and that I've ruined his life"
"Went insane"
"He slept on the couch"
"Like what has even happened"
"He's probably going to smear my name everywhere"
"Dude I don't know but I'm glad I'm leaving."
"It could have gone either way."
"That is a very sticky situation"
"I don't know what to tell you"
"Just because I was honest repeatedly"
"I fucked up my whole life Michael"
"He asked if I was cheating, I said no. Then he kept going on aboutif I was and I admitted to being in the verge of cheating. He can't deal with the idea of it AT ALL"
"Michael, I think Chris is done with me for good"
"leaving soon to trevors, then be there soon"
hahahahahaha
"the one with osteoporosis and bad breath from all his missing teeth"
"hes the old dog under the porch"
"you know how slow trevor is"

"matt would get it"

"oh psh"
"it wouldn't be good"
"matt is fragile"
"if we insinuate that your grandmother is bad"
"my mom is all"
"we can't say that"
"because there are things to do here"
"""so and so spent too much time around this sick person, and now you can see yourself that they are sick"""
"which ESCAPES me"
"he has no one else and he hates staying home all day"
"say like this"
"or, my mom"
"try to use me as an example"
"you and your mom need to have atalk with him"
"dude why does he like her"
"but i feel bad kinda"

Haha
"She is. That's why I am seeing a therapist because I know it's not okay"
"personally i feel she is taking advantage of you"
"We're ""friends"" who interact the same way without saying I love you"

"better pay for both of us"
"""no"""
"and chris is just"
"anyways, she was going to let her friend and family live in a shared condo on the beach and her mom was going to hire them both to work for her company.  and now kendall wants her mom to hire me and chris.  and rent a condo on the beach with us."
"that is SOME KINDA story"
haha
"oh no"
"she has crohn's and just left the ER, she's in there all the time.  she lives in VA beach but she was with her friend and her friend's husband and kid in lewisburg.  so she goes to the ER, and then her friend goes to ohio for some reason.  Her friend's husband then taqkes all of kendall's stuff, packs it up, and says she needs to go home.  so kendall cant drive 7 hours with her crohns flaring up and im letting her stay at my house tonight"
"haha okay"
"but its equally important maybe"
"oh no"
prepare
"this is going to be a long story so"
"today, kendall is coming into town"
"I have not changed those in my head yet"
"I have based part of my future on things I think she would like and be interested in"
"Like honestly, she said she wants to be as close as we used to, just in a different way. I mean, after so long under those terms it'll just reboot. I think she just needs a serious break."
Exactly.
Right.
"sometimes it's easier to fit into things if the label is off"
"putting a label on something doesnt change what it is"
"I totally understand what you're saying and agree with it"
"But I don't expect it."
"on the other hand, I'm prepared for the opposite of that"
"I think if two people are meant to be together it's not a huge deal if they break up. They will probably end up back together."
but
"I mean I'm pretty fucking upset"
"he doesn't have the emotionally maturity to deal with it"
"or start doing hard drugs"
"and without chris i would probablykill myself"
"Because I am poor and I would be back at my mom's without someone helping me"
"That's kind of what I feel like when I get to that point with Chris but then can't go further"
"I think we will probably end up together again honestly if we start hanging out."
"and it wasn't about that"
"OH and she made it really clear that she loved me"
"she was like hysterical. She said she ""needed to do it."" She said she didn't want to, but she needed to. She said she doesn't feel mature enough to be in a committed relationship, she said she wants to just be single. We ended on really good terms, and things are way less awkward than when she was kind of wishy washy about this. Like it almost feels like we're closer because it happened. I dunno. But we were both unbelievably upset and confused. And then it was that whole ""we can have the same dynamic minus the relationship part"" that everyone says, but I kind of believe this time, just for the fact that things have already kind of normalized. She said maybe in the future, but I just can't right now"" type of things.

haha
"you do know that matt just obsesses and what ever is cheapest and fastest and can give him the most short term pleasure is what he is going to do"
"them and underground reptiles"
"its like the worst place"
"it means it isnt, but it could still have mites / parasites because their animals are filthy"
"does that mean anything"
"it said it was not"
"and most likely it is also wild caught"
"it could show up dead"
"and this weather is terrible for shipping"
"pray you atcually get a chameleon"

"just keep the plants a bit lower for the most part, just allow for it to get up to the uv and heat"
"even if it's 2-3 inches?"
"matt's exo lol"
"what do you suggest we put the chameleon in when it arrives tomorrow"
"you have to face reality for the better"
"it would be like ripping off a band aid after its been stuck on and irritating you forever"
"I know. But what I'm afraid of is that she won't be irritated, and facing that would be a harsh reality"
"it would be good for you and if she really cares, you ignoring her will irritate her and youll see that"
"ignore her even"
"and just"
"but do that"
lol
"youre welcome"
"Thank you"
"That's good advice"
continue
"if she doesnt, continuw doing what youre doing"
"i mean just focus on what youre doing and if she comes back, good"
"at least slightly"
"because shes obviously interested in multiple other people"
"it demonstrates that maybe you deserve better"
Haha
"I will watch that"
"But I'm angry because I feel like I've lost control of an aspect of my life. And I feel like maybe I'm not as good as I think as I am because of the pieces of human trash bella is talking to. Does that just demonstrate that I have a complex or something else?"
"Like I'm sad for the obvious reasons"
hahaha
"watch catfish. you WILL feel better about it."
"I'm trying"
"and focus on yourself"
"try working extra hard on your goals that you need to work towards with or without her"
"I know that's the idea but I'm so depressed that I can't. It's a vicious cycle"
"then when you get back together it will still be pained"
"dont think about her constantly"
"well then, you should do the same.  live truly as if you are single."
"That is the point"
"her loyalty"
"so i guess the question is"
"i guess the point was to let her get it out of her system"
"i dont know man"
"wow that changes things =/"
"No but she said that she ""might"" and she ""needs to do this."" This isn't a break. I don't know what this is. She doesn't deserve someone who's okay with her doing this"
"is she getting with other guys or anything?>"
"Everything's fine. We still talk. Not a lot. But im still miserable. I mean that has to be it I guess"
"whats with the bella situation?"
"I don't know what to do anymore"
"I am so depressed dude"
lol
"yes dude omg go watch episode 1"

"Dude I've been watching catfish"
"That's a good point (I think)"
"Yep haha and every time I talk about moving Chris tells me that I don't know how bad land lords can be.  I don't think just because it could be worse is a reason to not explore options"

"yeah. I see it like this. Our relationship is only going to get more serious, and she needs that last bit of freedom before she's totally read to commit. which is fine"
"yea it's not a big deal and probably healthy"
"she was like if I wanted the relationship to end, i would break up. this is so it can continue. plus weve gone a month without seeing eachother. I'm not super worried"
"peace is good"
good
"bella and I are taking a break, and I feel really good about it. Like everything seems fine"
so
"ok elohim"

"AM I GOING THROUGH THE FIVE STAGES OF GRIEF"
"THIS IS WHY I AM ANGRY"
"ALL I WANT IS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND OF FOUR YEARS TO EITHER BREAK UP WITH ME OR STOP BEING COLD TO ME BECAUSE I TRY TOO HARD FOR THIS SHIT."
"RAWR ANGRY RAWR"
"yes i makes me"
"I AM SO ANGRY"
"that makes sense"
"i see isee"
"for stressing me"
"and then in turn, get angry at them"
OOPS
hahaha
ok
oh
"you hate yourself"
"i get upset from stress"
"because of this"
"those people make me have to fake a personality, plus they annoy me"
why?!
yeah
"i figured out why"
yes
"Is it driving you insane"
"its my social anxiety"
"I don't know what to do"
"its my office dude"
"its fine now for the moment"
"I'm sorry"
"chris wants to commit me"
"so you can get excited to come back the next day?"
"why look forward to leaving work?"
"but why?"
"leaving work"
"what do i have to look forward to?"
"i feel like my life in numb"
"I am a space alien"
"I just feel numb. Like my body is numb. All of the time"
"the earth"
"i need to leave"
"yea i dont know what to do"
"I've got so much to do. My job is important and I have people relying on me, jihn4 wants me doing all this stuff for him, and I just can't move. We are both stuck"
"and i know it's happening and it makes me hate myself more"
"he is growing resentful"
"but what do i do about chris"
"IF i can find any"
"killing myself, leaving chris, or doing drugs"
"which is better"
"yea it's ""odd"", that's a definite lol"
"im getting tangled in a web of words"
"are like ""cartoon style"" insanity"
"ironically the things i say"
"i displace my insanity but saying crazy things to you"
"i know im going insane"
"i seriously feel like im slowly but more quickly now going insane"
"i guess"
"yea that"
"THey are all so similar"
haha
"but i think it's displacement."
"good observation"
"but thats only projection"
"i really want to find every person i know and tell them why they should kill themselves"
"i dont know what to do"
"i know"
"i need someone"
"but i dont"
"i understand"
"i want away from everyone"
"i want to get away from chris"
haha
"rephrase that so I understand it"
"i dont want to die but christ i want drugs or something"
"but you dont want to make a mess"
"what do you do when you want to die"
"dude like"
"if i could afford to wear business clothes i would in a heart beat"
"i have to wear nice clothes though, which kind of sucks i guess"
"jesus that's awesome"
"not a big one, but one nonetheless"
"i do."
"you get your own office?!"
"i dont have that anymore"
"at least i had to focus on something constantly"
"i get my own office to work in in my new job, and my fear is that i will want to cry all day. before i had to walk all day"
"i wish i could do that but it isnt a ""let it all out"" cry, because ""it"" is infinite"
"i hate this"
"just so i can cry for like 2 minutes"
"i pretend to go to the bathroom"
"i am becoming you"
"this is normal now"
"have been for about an hour"
"dude im crying at my desk"
"or energy"
"i have no motivation"
"normally i can. that is why im upset. and when i realized that after i saw that, i still didn't want to it, i felt pretty pathetic"
"so i go home and smoke weed and eat like 4000 calories in 4 hours"
"normally with me i cannot eat during the day, at all"
"thats incredibly sad"
"i had to make another notch in my belt, because i'm losing weight from being to sick and depressed to eat. the notch was actually a personification of my misery. as i shoved the scissors through the belt i realized how pathetic i had become"
"my turn for a second, because what im about to say truly upset me"
"i'm sorry"
"i hate chris right now"
"I know"
": /"
"i locked myself into a situation that i hate"
"but usually I give you something"
"i know nothing will turn around"
"i know"
"im just venting"
"good thing im too poor to buy food"
"because I myself feel awful"
"I don't have the motivation or energy to come up with a good ""things will turn around"" speech"
"i am back wanting drugs again"
"i don't know what to tell you"
"i am sorry though"
"go for it man"
"what you're saying to me could be interpreted a lot of ways, and I'm just going to choose which one for myself"
"do whatever you want"
"and i say, sure, whatever it takes to be loved"
"i have cuts on my body because it would make someone else feel good to put them there"
no
"is it metaphorical?\"
"what does that mean?"
scars
cars
"i have literal scares of generosity"
"I agree with that last statement so hard"
"me fucking too"
"ive given too much of myself to the world"
"no one ever helps me like i help other people"
"no one likes me and i hate everyone anyways"
"im fat, im ugly, my animals arent good enough"
"people only use me to get something, i do drugs, i lie"
"about how i want to die and i hate myself and im only an object to people, i want to be alone forever"
"in response to?"
"""Dude if you're really as fucked up and shitty as you think you are, I must be a fucking moron."""
"and he says"

"not really, just saying how much i hate myself and he's taking offense"
"so im arguing with chris"
gauges
"i POSSIBLY remember her"

"No, she may be indian"
"i dont recall any black kids?  im assuming she's black"
"oh god lololol"
"Renesha something"

"oh god who is it"
"that I'm working with some weird girl that was in anat phys in high school and i was like NOOOOOOOO get out high school"
"i realized"
"at orientation today"
Dude
"you have"
"5 days a week straight is terrible"
"i know"
"ive been doing the daily hell for 2 years now haha"

"that is NOT a lot of time for therapy"
"she scheduled another therapy appointment for a week from today"
"I mean"
exactly
"on to"
"thats because when you identify the problem you can move onto the resolution"
haha
"I'd feel more secure in what my issues were"
"I truly wish it was as simple as her having a guy on the side"
"you know"
"i cant interpret this only because i have heard an argument every way for that type of behavior.  what comes to mind first is women being overly enthusiastic about their relationship when prompted because theyre having 
""secret relations"""
"Is this weird. I mean I say it at night, but never out of nowhere"
"I forgot we were in a weird place, and said ""I love you"" and she said ""I love you too!!"""
"based on all of the info I've given you about bella and I in the past week"
"so I need you to interpret this"
OK
haha
"my mom is getting ginos currently"
"hey if you can order pizza we should do that tooonite"
hahahaha
"that was a great event"
"yes do that"
"when I came over and we ordered all of that pizza, and watched VHS 2. Very specific, no?"
like
"off of one event"
"what if I based time"
"now it's hilarious"
"and it used to nauseate me"
"This is how she tells time"
"""Do you remember matts birthday this year, it wasbout four months before papaw passed"""
"""MICHAEL"""
HAAHAHAHAHHA
"""MICHAEL"""
"""my roof needs replacin'. it's been giving way since about 2 years before your papaw passed"""
"""MICHAEL"""
"""Remember when we went out cracker barell with kelley and gary, it was about 8 and a half months after papaw passed"""
"""MICHAEL"""
"let me cook up a story"
here

No
"IN YEAR 3"
"DOES SHE SAY"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA
"I'm not exaggerating"
"and everything after is AD"
"he is the year 0"

"she gauges time based on how long after or before his death"
"her calendar year is based on my grandfather's death"
well
"AND A CALENDAR"
"AS A CLOCK"

"she has no sense of time okay"
"and moment"
"up to that day"

"my grandma doe sthis hilarious thing"
"tis does"

"SOUNDS LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAAHAHA
RIGHT
"THAT STORY WAS SO SOLID"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"but my grandmother does it THIS bad, and my mom just a little better"
"and i don't care what anyone's definition of cooking is"
"I know all of this about aunt barb"
like
"""Okay, so your aunt barb--who just loves cooking but her husband left her for someone younger the poor thing was never easy on the eyes--is coming over for dinner later and we're going to have---well we aren't ""having"" anything lordee the last time i COOKED COOKED was when you were just a tot---but anyway we're gonna have chicken"
hahaha
"that I know aunt barbara really well."
"let's assume in this situation that I'm going to craft"
"here's my example"
"no in this case they are"
"i was thinking they are useful because that would explain my delayed responses"
"i'm like"
"interrupt themselves to insert useless details about the person or situation they are describing"
"and then"
"they'll tell me something"
like
"MY whole FAMILY DOES THAT"
"thnx 4 the deets"
"i knew you'd like that phrasing lolol"
"""sorry was watching portlandia and still am"""
"IS A HUGE FAGGOT"
"WHETHER HE IS GAY OR NOT"
"IM SORRY BUT THAT DUDE"
hahaha
HAHAHAHA
"hold on let me look., sorry was watching portlandia and still am"
"if he's gonna post a photo of what he really looks like"

"he's a nutcase dude."
"just a little"
"i gave him too much credit lololol"
"i misjudged him"
"deeper than i suspected"
"he's got issues"
"HIS JUSTIFICATION ISN'T EVEN REAL"
"no idea man"
"IT STILL MAKES NO SENSE"
"WHY WOULD HE MAKE THE TAG"
"STILL YET"
hahahaha
"BUT WHY STILL"
christ

BUT
HAHAHAHAHAH
"ben and jerrys peanut butter swirl"
"oh no"
hahaha
"WAIT FOR IT"
"he'll say he's in the photo"
"because he thought its patterned looked like"
"like if he's seen it"
"that's so weird"
"he tagged himself in a picture of one of my leopard geckos"
what
"she found me because trevor likes to tag me in stuff, and tag himself in my photos of animals and stuff"
"but she keeps talking to me"
"i do not know dude"
"what is the business"
"what is this page"
"IN BIKINIS"
"SOME UNDERAGE GIRLS POSING ON PICK UP TRUCKS"
HAHAHAHHA

"there's a new one"
"oh i only knew of the one incident"
"trevor's friend that he doesnt even know that well talks to me about animals constantly and then she just invited me to like THIS page  https://www.facebook.com/undergroundinkmilitiaclothing?notif_t=fbpage_fan_invite"
"kids in two states have tried to stab other people to death because they read that's how you ""see"" slenderman"
apparently
"on the bright side"
darn
"oh ok I see"
"i just am in a bad position currently"
"as long as i can pay my bills im fine"
"and 50 of that is usually spent on animal supplies"
"now we know that we have like 50-100 dollars of spending money each check"
"it does"
"if that makes sense"
yes
"oh like you hadn't acclimated to your new car-based budget yet"
"and i thought i was safe"
"because it was my first check after getting the car"
"like 4 weeks ago"
"so you bought geckos you shouldn't have?"
"ohh okay"
"i need 200 dollars to have them shipped, but i dont have to pay it all at once.  i already have 200 towards them"
"chris is trying to sell his galaxy tab.  if we can make it through this next check and get those stupid leopard gecko that i never should have bought paid off, we'll be in the clear"
haha
"because the car has taken a huge chunk of cash"
"well yea haha"
"more broke"
"yeah which is basically like"
": /"
"im still equally broke, i just have less things taken care of lol"
"i know"
"the problem now is that im not able to pay for everythig i need to because of my car"
"well honestly this is kind of the amount of poor i always am"
"this is rough"
"damn dude"
"now i dont have gas until the end of the week but i can usually sell something off in a crisis"
"got my pills, some dressing, and some mustard, and acne wash"
"well I'm sorry dude :/"
"it's fine."
"oh okay. sorry. was not reading all your messages clearly. I was at my aunts lol"
"...i know but im saying i cant sell you the most valuable animals in my collection, not even from a money stand point, i would do anything for my leachies"
"Matt doesn't want to breed them."
"My breeders are babies"
"They take 4 years to be able to breed"
"any leachies?  I only have 3"
"My mom said if you had any that she would pay you in installments and wouldn't take it home until the payment was complete"
"well tell him to let me know when he has a few hundo laying around"
"Matts ultimate goal is a leachie honestly"
"a baby"
"i dont really have any that i want to sell but if he would want one i would let one go"
"per chance"
"another crested"
"does matt want"
"And RIGHT"
"I asked him again and he said no"
"i cant believe how terrible the economy here is"
"Sorry dude"
"jeez nevermind im sorry im just so poor"
"does he"
"what doe she want?"
"Matt doesn't want a gargoyle"
"i just mentioned"
"about the baby"
"tell him"
Shit
"I mean"
Sooo
"She said yes but matt said no"
"what did your mom say, if anything?"
"it's not genetic but if i bred it people would flip out on me"
"but it's ""pet only"" because of the back"
"also it will be BLAZING red as an adult"
"tell ya what, i have a baby that i would sell.  it needs extra calcium because it was born with a spine deformity but it isnt life altering"
"she is only 21"
"they can get to 60-70 grams"
"lots of growing to di"
"its not tiny tiny but it's not big"
"because it is"
"tell him it's a juvenile"
"Matt said he doesn't want it because it's not a baby ._."
"tell me whats up, i have to leave soon"
"i have no phone service so"
"and if you guys are seriously intereste di need to run to wallgreens and i could bring her by"
"theres a photo i just posted"
"Matt will want to see her obvi"
"if you guys want to pay in installments im fine with that too lol"
"she's 21 grams, so bigger than sunny, and about half grown"
"Yeah I will for sure"
"would you talk to your mom about it?  it would buy me food haha.  I HAVE NO MUSTARD AND NO SALAD DRESSING.  THATS HALF MY FOOD, RUINED."
"Matt may be interested. I'm not sure exactly how much we could could go could go but it would be reasonable"
"but the guy backed out"
"i was going to let her go for 80"
lol
"i havent sold her, still trying to"
"i mean"
"Matt wants one so bad. If it wasn't too late you could get more from us for that"
Dude
"im selling a gargoyle ive raised for 2 years, for a measly 100 dollars, so i can eat and also get food"
"Poverty sucks"
"I'm sorry"
"dude i have like no food"
exactly
right
Those
THEM
"we'd be just like all of"
"if we didnt"
"i mean really"
"jesus how can we not"
"We treat everyone like lab rats"
"THAT'S AFFECTION FOR HIM"
"Hahahahahahahaha haha"
"i guess thats affection to him"
"because he's dumb"
"Hahaha why"
What
Hahahaha
"BIRD FLIPPIN"
"FLIPPIN TH EBIRD"
"dude you know he says hi to me in his car?"
HAHAHA
"And then he shakes his head like I'm a kid up to no good"
"So i wave"
"And Chad pulls up beside me and just looks"
"Dude I'm picking my mom up from work"
"Yeah he's got a huge work load. I suggest it"
"i guess i need to call john, he said one of his people would call me to schedule but that was a month ago"
"it sucks ass"
"yes i know exactly how you feel"
"it's like how you don't want friendships to end but also don't want to lose control"
"but I also don't want my relationship to end"
"because I am decent at figuring people out"
"It bothers me that I can't figure this one out"
"I hate not knowing what is going on, in ANY situation"
"yea this will be good because either way you will now know what the fuck is going on haha"
"there's a deeper issue"
"because you don't break up with someone, or attempt to if they make you happy, and you love them"
"that she could use to talk to me through"
"the therapist would be more like a facilitator in our case"
right
"because if she wont say what the issue is, you cant even start therapy lol"
"oh good, if you talk to someone with her you will finally understand the issue"
"I told her I was not ready to give up until we know what the real problem is though. She agreed to go talk to someone WITH me. I don't think I'm being unreasonable"
"I didn't think it was."
"thats not great"
"if shes talking about you with a therapist and is coming out with nothing at all"
"She just texted me after she got out and started talking to me"
"she would be saying ""michael, come over, we need to talk"" which is a more relaxed version of what she's done the other times she tried to end our relationship"
"If she had gotten insight"
"she'll get some insight"
"maybe if she hashes this out with a third party like a therapist"
"I just figured"
"you're right"
"dude shes tried to break up with you 3 times.  put all other things aside.  that in itself is an issue."
"everything after that was just like, our relationship felt like it was good. which is weird"
"and this was over the weekend"
"the other day she tried to end it for a third time, and then backed out again. And then I told her I was 50% of the relationship and I wasn't going anywhere until we figured this out one way or the otehr"
ALSO
"ok so she went to her therapist today. Primarily to talk about me is what she told me, because that's what she's having the most trouble with. She didn't say how it went one way or the other, but nothing seems to have really changed. Like things still feel weird, but she doesn't seem like she has anything new to tell me."
"tell meh"
"well it's a weird thing with bella and I don't know how to interpret it"
"what do you think about this"
hahaha
"yea she was eating a salad and must have walked off"
"haha like, just missing around the house?"
"hitler is arond here somewhere and hes looking for her currently lol"
"well ill tell chris to look into it"
yes
"is this a new thing?"
"are you downloading the unreleased aphex twin album"

yep
"i told you"
"look at the next comment"

like

"I HATE"
HAHA
persecutive
"because thats very"
"""ive been analyzing your behavior and my conclusion is that youre being distant"""
"you have changed moods what is up"

"is knowing what theyre doing"
"me too"
"the worst part about reading someone"
"i can read people"
"i hate that"
"instead of no they said ""nah"" which is clearly more passive than no, and they've left out capitalization and punctuation and replaced haha's with lol's"
ok
"and go"
"you can read what they say"
"hahaha yea"
like
"I hate when it's so easy to read people you can do it through texts"
"this is part of the reason i talk to josh.  i always feel like you feel right now."
"If you don't it only makes things worse"
"put feelings into words"
"you do. haha"
"ya just gotta"
"vent away"
"i do this to you"
"i know how you feel haha"
"because I am having a very hard time, and I am not used to feeling this way"
"I just need to vent"
"I know"
"but i really dont know her"
"i wish i knew bella better so i could help more"
"Yes, I know. Rationalizations"
"she's over reacting to things like finding other people attractive, or noticing that we are pretty different people."
"it's almost as if"
"rationalizations that I'VE MADE  to YOU about the differences between us"
"and it's just like"
"I have picked her brain about this"
"I am such a rational person and I strive for a single reason that she feels we aren't working"
"because she isnt going to actually DO anything"
"i was suggesting you make a move, because she wont, and break up with her"
"and stuck"
"she is confused"
right
ok
"type of thing"
"so she isn't fully committing either way"
"okay that makes sense"
"well i think that she doesnt even know what she's doing, like i said before.  she isn't dead set on anything so she isn't going to fully push you away.  she is being distant but she hasnt actually pushed you away.  she doesnt know."
"why would bella be keeping me so involved in her life if she was actually going to break up with me? Like talking to her mom about letting me have a piece of furniture, and even her grandparents. If this is so painful a choice why would she want to keep me attached to her in so many ways? does  she actually plan on doing it?

Yes, I know these are rationalizations and none of this is rational. Do not tell me that haha."
yus
"can I get your perspective on something"
"you dont have all the info"
"well it's because your problem is more convoluted"
about
"what is that bout"
"but I can not understand how to deal with my own"

"that's what he said to me"
Wat
"""I am sorry I was a dick. But it was all funny look at crazy conspiracy trevor. You can delete my shit if you want but im not"""
"Instead of replying to my messages he's commenting again"
noÃ«!
"And meanwhile he's posting passive aggressive statuses.  Woah, much adult."
"much social skills"
yea
"I feel like I can talk to just about anyone successfully.  You just have to know how they will react to what you say. I know if I asked why he was being a dick he would automatically have a reason to be a dick"
"the wording you chose was fine"
yeah
"I wanted to ask why he would say I'm being shady but he's got such a terrible unsightly temper"
"thats pretty clear"
"""Maybe I'm just incredibly confused and we are on two different pages but why do you think I would hurt that snake?"""

"how does this sound"
"then don't think about it right now"
"this effects my work =/"
"dont want to turn around"
"i think he's gone but im not sure"
"i would be mean to a snake"
WHY
"but i really do need to know"
"ill tell him my thoughts"
"and if he keeps being an asshole"
"im going to"
haha
"in person"
"you know"
"just pick his brain about why he said all that"
"you could get over this fight and resolve it with him"
"what a fucking idiot"
"why would he start an argument with someone he works near"
"so do i just go on with life and never speak to him again?  because he sits right fucking behind me"
hahaa
"that's why I said to just ignore it earlier"
"he wouldn't"
"he doesn't understand"
"he's on a level somewhere else"
"he's out of our universe dude"
"it's pointless"
"he won't grasp why"
no
"YOURE AN ASSHOLE"
"i need someone to be able to publically say to him"
dammit
"and the fun is gone"
"they wouldn't be delusions anymore"
Otherwise,
"just be like, youre fucking crazy, hunter and chris are the best witrh reptiles, they did everything for you, hunter took your dog to a vet"
"I'm not going to feed his delusions that I hate him"
"i responded and he never said anything"
"i would appreciate if you would offer a response"
"yes i did"
"you are money"
*PROFIT*
"did you read that full last comment?"
"WHAT MOTIVATION DO I HAVE TO BE MEAN TO A SNAKE"
"WE WOULD SEE THOSE IN WEST VIRGINIA"
"he said i was ""mean"" to a snake"
"but the size of the machines required to change weather"
"i hate him now dude"
"maybe the government does do fucked up shit"
OK
like
hahahahahaha
hahhaha
"of course it's the goddamn mountains"
"He doesn't understand life"
"I told you he was insane"
"""look at desserts.  theyre dry because of mountains"""
"and i said"
"he was like, well maybe mountains do something but they cant do much"
"and i said ""mountains do that"""
"yesterday he was talking about the government breaking up the storm in the valley"
"chris and i both looked at each other like you would if you saw someone beating a child but knew it wasnt your place to say anything"
"like loud and rough, scary"
"ive seen him get rough with them too"
"he cant care for those dogs"
"i should call the humane society on him or something"
"you did"
"the dogs he cant manage"
"i took his fucking dog to the vet"
"i have done EVERYTHING to help him"
"and he showed you reptiles"
RIGHT
"who knows man"
"it's as if you never did anything for him"
"why would he be so ungrateful"
"he's a nutcase"
dude
"youre a shitty person"
"i want my money"
"im going to have to text him later and be like, i regret giving you anything"
"let me just say one more time though, just for a second, how upset i am that trevor is so fucking retarded and such an ingrate"
hahahaha
"but I think I'm close"
"also that's a guess"
"but dude her mom has an IQ of about 79...She's not super influential"
"she could be telling her all sorts of things that she's doing wrong"
"her mom doesnt have to, she's right there all of the time"
"remember, my mom barged into my house to interject in my relationship with chris"
"she still lives with her mom so i dont know how much that is effecting her"
"and that would make sense for anyoen to feeel"
"I understand"
"but thats how i feel"
"now im not saying i know thats how she feels"
yes
"with what you just said"
"which ALSO plays a big factor"
"she is younger than me"
"like you said"
"That is a good explanation that might match up"
"but i dont necessarily find it ideal"
"and i know this is probably tghe best thing for me"
"im in this forever now"
"and that kind of makes me resentful"
"i didnt get the teen out of my system"
"i feel like i committed maybe too early"
"i feel like if i could make it on my own i would, and i want to more than anything.  i am angry with myself that i require another person to succeed and it makes me sort of bitter."
sure
okay
"lol let me give you some perpective possibly from bella's view.  i cant speak for her, but i can explain how i feel about a very similar situation"
"i dont even know what they are anymore"
haha
2010
what
"and I haven't actually HAD relationship issues since"
right?
"i have enough on my plate as it is"
"i hate having to deal with relationship issues"
"right, fully understood"
"which made my situation ideal"
"everything else in my life requires A LOT of effort"
"like it required almost no effort"
happy
"we were honest with eachother"
"we didn't really fight much"
"my relationship has always been the easiest part of my life"
"but it's like"
"that's true"
"well you know youre only 20 and this is not the prime time of your life.  it is, but this is a good period of time where mistakes matter slightly less.  as long as youre going to school and headed in some sort of finite path, everything else is icing"
"I am happy where I am"
"because people in their 20s...they're way different. and usually awful people"
"and I don't think I'd be able to put myself through looking again"
"Which is my point exactly"
"because people as a whole are terrible and should all die"
"it's so hard to find smoeone you can deal with 24/7"
"I don't think I have the social skills"
"like If i had to start over and see other people whenever that would happen"
hahahaha
"but I am comfortable and happy now. However if this does end i wont know what to do. The last girl I had to ""talk to"" was 15. I'm not equipped to deal with adult human beings."
"dude that's awesome!"
"I am comfortable and happy with what I have now"
"chris starts school next month and in a year he can start getting certifications so finally ill be able to quit this fucking place"
"my issue is"
"Which sucks"
"that's true."
happen
"which would hapopen with me"
"well that and if you break up you wont be worried about where youre living now"
"we can have space when we want it"
"I think that holds some truth"
"like it's an issue."
"however i think that the fact that you two dont really rely on each other for food and shelter will help your situation no matter what happens"
"she can't even decide what icecream to get at the grocery store."
"she is too"
"because I am so depressed and fatigued and I can't do this forever"
"im really terrible at decision making"
"right, i understand that"
"but it ultimately NEEDS to lead to something"
"I can endure it"
"so just endure what you can"
"it's not fair that she's keeping you waiting but it's what she's doing and you dont want to end it"
"i dont know, i guess just wait"
well
"i can relate lol"
"but it's not the worst"
"which isn't the best thing"
"she has NO ONE to talk to about this but me"
"her friends are all so superficial"
"because it's like"
"but after I do it I'm not happy about it"
right
"I can separate reason and emotion pretty easily"
"and become really objective"
"I go into friend mode"
"when I have these conversations with her"
"much more level headed than chris"
"thats good"
"something like that"
"If you wanted to end this, you'd have done it the first time you said you were going to. It would have been incredibly difficult, but in situations like this people always say it because they know it's what they want no matter how challenging it is. If you want space, I can give you space, if you want time, I can give you time. But, I'm not going to just go away if you don't know whether or not you want me to. You need to really think hard about this."
"i said"
"here's what I told her"
"but it does mean real life consequences if she doesnt straighten it out"
"it's meaningless because it's coming from her fears and out of nowhere"
"everything she said is emotionally driven but only slightly meaningless"
"HAHA a tape"
"she's so happy when she's with me, and she's all ""I'll get my shit straightened out I promise"" as if everything she's said is meaningless and emotionally driven"
"MAKE A TAPE"
"BUG HER PERSON"
"because it's like"
"she's going to see a therapist monday"
"this sounds like me"
yep
"she has told me she doesn't know what she wants"
"at worst"
"she gets lost in her thoughts or something"
"Being away from me like causes this problem where"
"and everything calms down"
"and we talk in person"
"""come over"""
"she just will say like"
"or phone call"
"she doesn't vent through text"
"but here's the thing"
"and that causes problems"
"it's easier to vent emotionally over text"
"when im not with chris is when the fights happen"
"this makes sense too"
"then I leave."
"nothing seems different"
"and like"
"her mom is like giving me a piece of furniture for my apartment"
"like nothing has changed basically"
"why is everything so good when I'm there"
"it's like"
lol
"so wait"
"either wait or break up with her"
"waiting is a good idea as well"
"I have to wait to understand more"
"ya know?"
"so I can't act based on assumptions"
"but There's no way of knowing 100%"
"that is a good explanation"
"and that's where i think the guilt comes in"
"so if being with another guy is exciting and fun but also painfulk, she would deal with the pain just for something different"
"you want to feel SOMETHING"
"whats really weird about BPD is you hate feeling the way you do but you have to have something that makes you feel some way"
"yeah you sound right"
"why has everything been solid up to this point"
"sounds like she's on a self destructive streak or something, needs change, needs to feel something"
"but that begs the question"
"yeah i see your point i see your point"
"I do know."
"something someone with BPD wants but doesnt need"
"and you know, that was a rocky dramatic romance"
"she did dude"
"i mean she dated zach pauley for a couple years"
haha
"wait who is trash"
"it's important"
"you need to keep that in mind"
"and HE is trash"
"please stop ignoring the fact that she got with him"
"i told you he looks like zach pauley"
"In most situations, she wouldn't even want to be acquaintances with this guy"
"is this guy looks like a dirty rodent, has nothing going for him, and acts like a prissy girl on the internet"
"SO MAD"
"but what makes me mad"
"I don't even really tweet that much"
"I dunno"
"just like to establish how much thye have in common?"
like
"they always suspsciously favorite selective tweets"
"sending photos to someone usually establishes a solid friendship"
"they just became friends like a couple weeks ago"
"they snap chat a lot"
"I don't know how good of friends they are"
see
"that is suspicious"
"if his name was not there at all and theyre really good friends"
"just the usual friends that I know"
"but his name was not there."
"I did look at her phone when she got a text  the other day, and saw the names of her conversations"
but
"she's become really good friends with that bradley legg guy"
"if anything"
"also if you break up for a few days, youre very likely to see what she's hiding"
"I want to know what to be upset about"
"youre the chris here.  so do what chris did.  break it off and let the reality sink in, let her be afraid"
"I just want definitive answers"
"She's lucky that I have as much patience as I do, which I don't feel like is a lot more than most people"
"It would already be over."
"No one else would put up with what she is doing to me right now."
"I mean to be frank"
"you have a point"
"theres a chance of that, but that part is so small and insignificant that the worst i could see happening is her hooking up with a guy, remembering how shitty guys are, and getting back with you"
"I'm going to be selfish."
"That's not a chance I'm willing to take"
"it could win"
"there's still this small part of her that doesn't want this"
"If I did do that"
"Here's the thing"
"I'm like a puppy someone has kicked in the road. I've been in bed all week, aside from when I'm with her. I don't know if I can do ANYTHING at this point but wait"
twice
"chris has done it to me"
"so?  youre opposed to her games.  youve been so accepting in dealing with her being like this.  you should do something to fix it, and i think thats what it would take"
"I don't know if I have the emotional strength to even suggest it"
"I just"
"I actually tried to get us to take a ""break"" and she was so opposed to it"
"because i think she will"
"are you afraid she wont come back?"
"but I can't"
"That's such a good suggestion"
"that's a realistic view.  i have a suggestion.  right now she has all the power and doesnt know what to do with it, she's like a confused child.  take the power back so that she has time to think.  she feels guilt.  break up with her for a day or two, let her think about the relationship without any hang ups"
"She's going to talk to guys, and think she wants to break up for the next month, and then realize that they aren't anywhere as good as I am and stop doing it. I am going to suffer immensely. She might cheat on me. But I don't think it's going to ""end"" unless I am unable to take it any longer."
yes
Honestly?
"because you and i both know you can see into the future"
"i dont know, how do you realistically see things turning out?"
but
sorry
"hahaha ""feminism"""
"it can make things like whats happening right now much harder"
"I don't need that shoved in my face"
"which is fine"
"i think"
"she is all feminist about marriage"
hm
okay
independent
"independent? or non committal?"
"I didn't expect her to be all into talking about that"
"bellas very...independent"
"and kids and stuff"
"they usually jump the gun about it as well"
"girls normally want to look forward to getting married when theyre with a guy they like for a long time"
"We haven't crossed that bridge yet"
"that's nweird"
"you havent talked about it at all?"
"like why even say it"
"but we had plans for after school"
"that's ridiculous"
"it's not like we've talked about getting married or anything"
"i am just so sick of hearing ""I want to be with you forever"" when it's not going to happen"
"it could be"
"that's what we should be doing in terms of relationships"
"it cuold be her young brain telling her to not commit to something for forever and she's afraid"
"and we should be drifting out of 3 month to two year relationships"
"bella is even younger"
"keep in mind that we are young"
"i wonder all of the time the same thing"
"I want to know so badly what changed"
"but this has been going on almost four years just as it had in the first 6 months"
"like if she had ended it right before college"
"if this were even a two year relationship"
"its just"
*some
"but It's hard to believe it isn't"
"youre probably trying to overlook so key facts and behaviors"
"I know it's not"
"im sure from your view it does"
"well right now everything doesnt seem top be fine"
"everything in my relationship seemed to be fine"
"and like in this situation"
"the other person always does it first"
"Even when I'm going to"
ever
"i've never broken up with anyone"
like
"we're codependent people"
"i know the feeling, why do you think i was with (insert terrible ex's name here)?"
"i'd rather be treated poorly than not at all"
"but i don't know what i'll do if it goes away"
"i don't deserve this"
"i feel like i shouldnt offer my opinion because shes sounding like me when im just totally over a situation"
"she seems disconnected"
"compared to this morning or even last night"
"but like"
"yes a little"
"so she just seems disconnected?"
hm
"i keep getting tossed around"
"it's just"
"i'll ask"
"well if i'm ever over there again"
"that much is for sure"
"her family would obviously prefer that she stays with you"
"or like"
"thats what im saying"
"i don't know what the bias would be"
"i dunno"
"her family adores me"
well
"Her mom"
"have you talked to her mom? as bad as that sounds you could get some easy insight that way.  her mom can say things to tip you off"
"I don't either."
"i dont think she has anyone secret at her house"
"i doubt theres a person causing this"
hrm...
"it could literally be just her wanting to be alone"
"I can't stop obsessing"
"and without reason she said she hasn't showered or anything and it's not a good time. but like, she's been working on making jewelry for festivall since early this morning and last night, so she's busy, but it upsets me. She said tomorrow after work might be better but I have plans tomorrow night, and then i said saturday and she said ""yeah"""
"I was going to go to bellas"
nothing
"What happened? :/"
"i'm so sad I'm dying. I can not be happy for five minutes."
"Dude I'm so bored I'm dying"
"HE KNOWS NOTHING"
"Who cares"
"What does he even know"
"and he had it for like an entire hour before i picked it up, and it NEVER BIT HIM so I MUST BE MEAN TO IT"
twice
"because it bit me"
"he is saying that im treating the snake badly"
"Qhat was it"
"I wasn't following it"
"But his arugmwnt"
"He is"
"he is seriously so fucking stuck up for someone with so little"
"i dont know but he acts like a child"
"What is his deal"
Dude
HAHA
"trevor is not my friend anymore"
"in one fucking FB post"
"dude so it's crazy, and sorry to derail, but"
"So that part is done"
"I've addressed it as much as I can"
"yes some form of it"
"If I just ride it out there will be some normalcy"
"But you're right"
"its the easiest and hardest option"
"It is"
"i hate it too"
"and i know that's the most terrible thing to do"
"see what happens"
"i mean, the only thing to do is ride it out"
hm
"to make sure things are going fantastically"
"trying way too hard"
"but I'm going all out"
"But like i dunno what chris's response was"
"i understand your point"
yeah
"and now ims eeing the effect it had on him"
"or am i wrong?"
"Can't you not even have anacondas outside of cali?"
"i almost feel guilty for doing this to you because i did it to chris"
"i know"
"And there is no answer to anything"
"not walk on eggshells"
"I just want to remain happy"
"she should be good for at least awhile lol"
"its been twice now"
"well i mean"
haha
"I just figured i'd give it a shot"
"I figured"
"its all circumstantial"
"i couldnt tell you the answer to that even if it were concerning me and chris"
"well dude i dont know"
"or will it probably be continuous"
"is it gonna be the issue still there, without the trying to break up with me"
"how many more times should I expect bella to try and break up with me"
lolol

"no i couldnt"
"you just COULDNT resist HAHAHA"

"he doesn't even make any sense"
"just eliminate his opinion"
"stop caring"
"who cares"
"for being a liar"
"i want to call him out though"
"his opinion is invalid"
therefore
"just delete all his comments"
"ignore him"
"im going to lose my shit"
"im going to lose it"
"is he for real MR"
"dude what is he talking about"
"iit's neglect"
"that's like abusive"
"and last night, when i was trying to get him to let me take the snake, he was saying ""i want to sell it right now!"""
"if you cant afford their care"
"then you cant have animals"
"then tuesday he comes up to me telling me he has 10 dollars to his name"
"not cool"
"i heard about that shit"
"then he came by to get them, said ""ill pay you tuesday"", and left"
"he asked us to grab him 2 live mice at the pet store and he would come by later and get them"
"he tricked me and stole money from me too"
"no he's just retarded"
hahahahaha
"is that a government thing"
"he is so afraid to actually say what he is thinking"
"calling me an animal flipper for christs sakes"
"i hope you can see that shit"
"i hope you see trevor fighting me on my status"
"i would only want that if i can tame it down"
"also i think if it becomes illegal to have him i can be grandfathered in"
"or 13 feet"
"it could get 8 feet"

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA
"I had a dream I had a tortoise called a ""gorilla tortoise"" and it was giant and had skin like bark. It was also infected with bugs. Today on my windshield, I watched the same kind of bug taunt me with its tendrils as I drove and almost died on the interstate staring it down as it gazed into my face."

LOL
hahaha
"me too. The thing with the old woman was so convenient she probably thinks I paid her off"
lolol
yay!
"but im glad everything worked out"
"HAHAHA such an odd series of events"
"She wanted a break, tried it for one day, and she called me super upset because she wanted to see me. Obviously she just wanted to try it to see what life was like without me, ie whether it was better, but I guess it's not even for 24 hours. I hope. But we just started hanging out like nothing happened, and then this old lady like thought we were married at kroger, and gave us relationship advice and gave this weird what I'm assuming bella interpreted as ""cosmic"" perspective where she was like ""if you've been together 4 years 55 isn't that hard"" and I was like whoa that was weird but everything seems to be back to normal now"
"ok so basically"
"okay haha im leaving to go ""hangout with trevor"" (said sarcastically) so i may not be able to respond quickly"
"Let me put laundry in and get my laptop so I can explain"
"chris and i always have ""resurgences"""
"what happened with that hahaha"
Lol
Jesus
"I typed a lot to say so little"
"7-3 but bella is coming over tomorrow night because we recently had this weird resurgence in our relationship of some sort and I'm not sure why but okay"
"well what time?"
"And yes"
"They look like blue freckles or where led went in my skin"
"do you work tomorrow?"
"yes i do that"
"I just became obsessed with then"
"No they've always been there"
hahaha
"you know panic can make that shit appear"
"HAHAHAHA OH GOD what type of """"blue spots"""
"I have these weird blue spots on my body a mole that's clearly not cancerous but I'm convinced I was abducted by aliens and in laughing reading this"
"world is ending, spiraling, spiraling"
"oh i see, so full mental panic as well"
"I am panicking in the sense that you do"
"I took 2 mg of valium and xanax and my palms keep sweating"
PILSS
"and stop having panic attack, take pills for it"
"and i knew about your sister"
"why does he have a mansion"
"woooah lolol"
"But my dad is living in a 15000 square foot home, my sister is abusive to my family and is compulsively shop lifting,  and I can stop having panic attacks"
"Thanks to an odd series of events"
"So everything is fine now"
"Dude what's up?"
"how's that?"
"I am at bellas"
"The Majestic Happy Chicken-Footed Spiny-Backed Slime Devil."
"so if things do sour, come out of it ready to continue living your life"
"you have to remember, as i often do sometimes, that there was life before this person.  this person is not your entire life.  you are your life."
"it's your life, you need to control it"
"evaluate your needs and what's best for you"
"this is the part where you have to become your own person and think about yourself and not the relationship"
=[
"I can't"
"I just"
"i could be wrong"
"I know"
"I can't handle this"
"im not trying to be terrible, im just trying to clarify from experience"
no
god
"she is trying to pull away and she doesnt want you to come over and get even more involved just for it to blow up and end in flames"
"I'm gonna die"
"she thinks it wouldnt be good for because"
"she's pulling away"
man
"she wants me to come over, but she doesn't know if that would be good for me?"
"or maybe she sees your life standards and doesnt feel the need to live up to them"
"could be distance even"
"could be her mom, could be her, could be another dude"
"you just have to figure out what it is"
"it's very obvious that the problem is completely on her end"
"not you"
"she's upset with herself"
help
"she says she's so upset and cant calm down"
"why would she be upset right now"
"i speak girl"
"if i could read some of what bella is saying to you i could probably decipher it in some way"
"yeah I getcha"
"it's always good to have leverage"
"like a dog"
"and he follows my lead"
"i like him because he likes me"
"i dont even know"
"thats so weird dude"
"im like ugggghhh...okay?"
"and right after he goes SAY YES"
"and i said no"
"he asked after lunch if i wanted coffee"
"and when we went to lunch he was way happy to be there lol"
"i dont even initiate conversations anymore"
"that's kinda sad"
"and talking to me"
"hes with his family, man"
"he's at the zoo and is telling me about the komodo dragon"
"oh no"
hahaha
"and he's been sending me photos"
"he ran over here the other day to tell me, as if i needed to know, that he was going to be out of town for the week"
"josh is obsessed with me officially"
haha
always
"it works in the begining"
"testing people always ends up bad"
"if i've learned anything"
"which i dont like"
"but i have no control"
"im testing him"
"every day i just sit here and wait to see if he reaches out"
"but he may not be upset, he may just be indifferent"
"ive asked several times if he's upset with me, and he always says no"
"that's the one everyone is afraid of"
"which is the one im afraid of"
"or he genuinely decided he doesnt like me"
"either too busy"
"hmmm that's true"
"no fake offer means too busy to come up with one"
"i mean a fake offer means you've got ulterior motives"
"but not full on plans that he breaks"
"yea he halfway fake opffers, sometimes"
"maybe he's not blowing you off"
"maybe he is busy"
"which tells me"
"oh so he doesn't even do the fake offer thing"
"i dont know, every time i ask him to hang out, he explains why he cant, or he ignores me, but he never says ""how about tomorrow?"" or anything"
"maybe he was just being a standup guy"
"but dude i dunno"
"like that way that old people say things about poor people when you know the wanted to say black people"
"when chris told trevor that he thought i had a crush on him, trevor said something like ""dont worry, hunter isnt my type anyways"" and that sort of hurt.  felt like he was saying im fat."
"you probably weren't even offensive"
"over thinking something"
him
"it was just like"
"he wasn't really offended"
"if you did"
"i hope i didnt offend him or something"
"i know. i did too"
"i thought he was a good friend"
"i know"
"and it makes me very sad"
"and i have a feeling itll not happen again"
"because i cant keep asking him to hang out"
"what i did"
"i ant him to tell me what went wrong"
"but so far, that's it"
"he is still ""liking"" my FB stuff, and talking to me at work"
correct
basically
"i mean"
"basically nothing has changed"
but
"and then he proceeded to tell me WHY he was busy, everything he had done since he left work, emphasized that he has almost no money even on payday, and said he is cooking dinner"
"""dude i apologize if im out of line but is there a reason that we havent hung out since you got your ride?  i know you have been limited in what you can do but it's like we were all having fun together one day, the next day there's no interaction at all.  im incredibly confused."""
"lets see"
ok
"i sent him this:"
"last night i straight up asked him whats up"
"i still cant figure out this trevor thing"
"That's why privacy is privacy"
Exactly
"and that's only because of his issues"
"he does find things that make him ill sometimes"
"chris always says that but he looks anyways sometimes"
"First, I respect her too much and would rather her share things with me on her own. and two, if I did find something i didn't like I would be so miserable"
"Two reasons"
"I couldn't."
"I wouldn't do that at all."
"I won't."
"i would only do that in dire crisis mode"
"im assuming you wont go through her stuff and see for yourself"
"that's true"
"but not when there isn't anything left to question"
"i dont know, this is so relatable to me right now"
eh
"well you always want to question things"
"she is still questioning our relationship"
"and after all of this"
"and she doesn't want to break up with me"
"she says she loves me"
"and I know I do"
"she tells me that I do everything right"
"is that I know I've done nothing wrong"
"My main issue right now"
"no hard feelings on that"
"oh i understand that dude"
"if she says I do want you to come over, I am not going to hangout with you. That's just how I am today, and I can not control it."
"tell meh"
"Here's something you should know"
"i just like"
"will you be driving or will you require a driver?"
"we can still hang out"
"well that's okay"
=///
SUCKS
"at 7 am"
"which sucks"
"Yes. but I also have work in the morning"
"i dont want you alone and sad"
"do you want to hang out after work?"
well
"yea i know that sickness"
"and it won't go away"
"like when someone is about to tell you bad news specifically that one"
"I just have that feeling in my stomach"
"but mainly about dependance and commitment"
"it sort of is"
"it's kind of about love"
"it's about strategy and having someone to help you"
"its not about love"
"well yea if you observe ""happy"" long relationships, the people generally are quite different and dont really like each other that much anymore hahaha"
"because relationships tend to not make sense"
"I am kind of over that"
"but like"
"why is this happening"
"like this doesn't add up"
"because it just means she thinks like someone who's curious"
"I'm okay with"
"which honestly"
"She's just started trying to rationalize our relationship"

"now is not the time to doubt you"
"I know"
"you got a job for christ sakes"
"you havent changed"
"it sounds to me like youre not the problem at all"
"does that mean I'm great without the capacity to be bad, or just bad"
"like I haven't been acting differently at all"
"she claims i didn't do anything differently than I've always done"
"but it's like"
"and Now I want to try"
"and did the same thing"
"she sensed it"
"I think I've been emotionally distant"
"here's what I think"
"god you know me"
"because it seems like this is something you would do, but you would make it painless"
"are you only upset by it because she is the one pulling away and not you?"
well
"On paper we aren't a good match."
"it's the same one I was struggling with"
"if she cant tell you, that's bad"
"tell her that you need to know exactly what the issue is"
god

"see how similar it is"
"could be a classic chris and hunter scenario"
"or didn't want to tell me the real reason"
"but I don't know if she was obsessing"
"Like she has severe OCD and tends to obsess"
"She said she's like...been noticing how ""different"" we are lately. I was like I've noticed that our entire relationship and kind of think it's an okay thing"
"in this case i will tell you, if something does happen it is a door closing and a window opening.  everything happens for a reason, everything falls into place, etc etc.  i have known this to be true."
"but look what good that's done"
"I'm constantly downplaying my relationship with her as a defense mechanism so i don't get hurt"
"but I feel so sick"
"that's also a very good point"
"I asked her if she was"
"I don't think so"
"because if he is giving her mixed signals, she will also give you mixed signals"
"is she talking to a dude?"
.....
"I want space again"
"and now she's like"
"come over tomorrow like you said"
"and she said no"
"and I offered her space"
"then she said it was the right decision not too"
"she didn't"

"That's pretty well laid out.  I guess I can see that.  I'm trying to connect with him now on a ""you're my friend, let me confide in you so you know I'm not pushing you away"" type deal"
"Either way, me deleting him was the first sign that you used him and are now pulling away methodically"
"He's a conspiracy theory guy who's super paranoid. He could just think you're a robot"
"the rough time with chris thing is just a theory, he could think you were using him for literally ANY reason."
"that you were having a rough time with chris, used him to get through it, and are slowly pulling yourself away from him starting with me, next it will be chris, and then finally you'll be out of his life totally"
"He assumes"
"This isn't my fault, but I did start something"
"In deleting him from my friends, which I really just meant to unfolllow him, I have created a mess"
Well
"You aren't"
"I don't see how I could be though. Explain?"
"He can identify because in his world you ARE doing thast to him"
"i mean think about what he said to you"
lol
"he's a nice guy"
"I don't think he's an asshole, I just think he's kind of slow mixed with a lot of paranoid"
"Then this IS a mess"
"If that is true"
"He thinks exactly what you are thinking"
"why wouldn't he think you were untrue to him"
HAHAHAHA
"He thinks our government makes it rain"
"because he's a paranoid insecure mess"
"You know that kind of would make sense. Why else would he ask if he has ""fallen from my graces"""
"Based on his past behavior, maybe he was just being incredibly paranoid. He may think YOU used HIM. He might not think you're genuine, because he doesn't think ANYONE is genuine. I.E. he's a little more ridiculous than you were prepared to deal with"
OR
"He may be a huge ass hole"
"There's something we may not have considered"
"can I say something really quick about this"

"What a jackass"
"Dude he's not worth it he was totally looking for an out"
"God damn"

"people just run from me"
"trevor has started straight up blowing us off and ignoring us.  like ""ill see if i can come down later"", and then no response to anything and just more excuses.  today he said hi to me a couple of times but made no effort to make plans or anything.  and then mike comes over and proceeds to tell me about how he relapsed on the best heroin he has ever seen in the state.  i just want to fall over and die.  why am i always being shit on by everyone?  i try so hard"

"what in the hell hahahahaha"
"9 years ago .....a person named Jerry got dared to sleep in a house that was believed to be haunted. The next day his friends waited for him outside the house....They had to go inside and search for him. They went through every room but the attic. He wasn't suppose to sleep in the attic. He was suppose to sleep in the living room they went to the attic. They found Jerry's corpse and they left because they got scared. But that night all died because of their friend. He killed them all for making him sleep in the house if you don't send this to 11 comments you will die tonight by Jerry.Example 1: a man named stewart read this and didnt believe it. He shut off his computer and went through his day . That night while he was in bed he heard something out his door. He got up to look his dead now. Example 2:a girl named Haley read this in the morning and she got scared but didn't send it . She wanted to know if it was true. She went to school ( she was only 13 years old) and that night she died. If you dont post this to 11 comments tonight Jerry will 'visit' you and he isn't fake. Apparently if you copy and paste this to 11 comments in the next ten minutes you will have the best day of your life tomorrow. You will either get kissed or asked out, if you brake this chain you will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. In the next 53 minutes someone will say I love you or I'm Sorry"

"but if i focus on small things i will focus ont he small things he's doing to annoy me and tear it apart"
"If you focus on how you are equals you are lying to yourself, which is idiocy. If you focus on your superiority, that will skew your value placed on him. What you need to do is not focus on human merit. Focus on smallers aspects of the relationship"
so
Ok
hahahahaha
well
"if i just use him to feel better about my amazing abilities"
no

"all 8 1/2 hours every day"
"im working a 6 day week"
"im having to listen to washe dout so i dont have a meltdown and leave work"

true
"Because, you haven't tried in this respect yet"
"You haven't touched that time at all"
"When you aren't achieving results."
"at what point am i being a fool for dealing with it?"
"You have to do things to work with it"
"Some people are just like that."
"but now i see that if i dont say something, he wont notice anything"
"at first i didnt want to say anything because i wasnt done observing, i wanted to give him as many chances as possible to think about his words and actions"
"then just prepare yourself to react appropriately"
"yea thats a good idea.  and it will, trust me."
"What you do is you tell him that you'd appreciate a thank you sometimes, and remind him that you aren't mad, but he often doesn't say thank you. Don't say it unless the situation presents itself again"
"but i cant find anybody better to hang out with"
"No. Neither."
"or do i just ignore it and continue to secretly hate him?"
"so do i ask him why he has never said thank you for the things i have done?"
"1) you are JUST NOW, getting to finally truly know him. A person is defined by actions not words and tales, which you are finally seeing.
2) Understand that the alpha behavior is typical of anyone in his situation no matter the personality. Doesn't matter if he loves you or hates you. Humans are competitive. Especially two males spending infinite time with one female."
"at what point can you ask a person why they have never said thank you to you?"
"It just means two things"
"It doesn't mean he's different than he is"
"im getting angrier and angrier with his lack of respect for me and my house and my car and my animals"

exactly
"it's like, meaningless to you, and has no effect on them in reality"
"AND THE STORY IS WORTHLESS"
YES
"Although they are not, and I know more than tney do"
"do you ever get around people who want to talk and talk and talk but they sound retarded so you keep trying to interject and they talk over you so eventually you stop trying and just start seething while they finish their bullshit no-lifer story?"
"I'm constantly asking coworkers obvious questions to make them feel like they are worth something to me."
"and then got short with her as I dumbed myself down."
"I picked up on her low intelligence really quickly."
"and had to replace any jargon about mental illness with ""nuts"" and ""crazy"" and then we started talking about school and I had to pretend i took really simple classes I didn't take,"
"I was talking with this girl about her borderline mom the other day"

"he lives in the house he grew up in, but without his parents, and the house is in shambles because he's too depressed to keep it up"
"He may or may not share them"
"I'm gonna guess that his parent and childhood issues go deeper than he has shared."
"it is"
"That's a sad story."
"yeah i can see that"
"and then after that, no more sadness"
"just seem numb"
"but not seem bothered by it"

"but he's out of his mind stupid"
"which is fine"
"I thought he was just different"
"Because this guy is an actual moron, and it's insulting to me that he thinks natural medicine is a thing"
"youre being a real josh right now"
"I don't have the tolerance"
"I can't be around him."

"Okay why does he say that he did it."
"he did it because he believes in natural medicine"

"where he was smoking our weed while he had none"
AND
"i swear"
"oh my gosh haha"
"he just HAD all of that"
"one morning before he hung out with me"
"in one day"
"he got a car loan, his learners, his license, and a new car picked out"

"lhe sits nehind me at work"
"I KNOW DUDE HES THE BEST"
"I have never met someone so different me that is so easy to get along with lol"

"a FREAK about it"
"hes a freak about organic stuff"
"he likes to show us youtube videos"

"to plant in his yard"
"out of the ground, by the roots"
"he took a fern"
hahahahaha
"YOU GUYS NEED TO BRING ME BACK, ILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN THEYRE IN BLOOM"
"LOOK AT ALL THE BLACKBERRY BUSHES"

"and i believe we are now his best friends"
"no way"

"OBSESSED with plants"
"that dude is like"
"dude yesterday we took trevor hiking to the farm"

"yes. I am that good at being an idiot."
"i cant te;ll"
"did you make that up?"

"I have tomorrow off hang out"
"BACK TO TEENS BYE"
"Just take time to think"
Okay
"im not crazy, im not just going to quit right now"
"Or seriously consider what I'm saying"
"I can't talk now, but don't do that."
No.
"i cant be here around these people.  they find my suffering hilarious.  especially martin."
"i think im about to quit my job and start cleaning houses or something similar"
"this weird type of super friend bond is forming.  obviously nothing close to our super friend status but this dude genuinely appreciates all of our help and no one ever does, no one ever says thank you to us and especially no one tells others how nice we are"
"I will later haha"
"dude have you added him on FB?  you have to see what he just posted about us giving him food and me taking him to the vet...it's like he has never had people care about him before"
"And dogs"
"You are like an emt for skateboarders"
"he called me at like 8 AM,"
"that made me feel really good"
"you know what is a good feeling?  waking up to see that someone had a crisis and you were the first person they thought of to ask for help"
"it was fun getting away from my desk though"
hahahaha
"the dog got hit by a car and was just bruised"
"Haha what"
"nothing else lol"
"dog was bruised up"
done
"Good luck"
"so wish me luck"
"okay i have to go help him and his dog"
"just try and take a mental deep breathe"
"your head is just out of control with racing thoughts. Just negative ones"
"But you will."
"You can't now."
"Then try and keep your thoughts from racing. Focus on the fact that you're going to be able to hangout with trevor and help his  dog."
"i hope he does"
"i think he may actually need me to do that"
"to leave work and take trevor to get his dog help"
"what do you feel you need"
"like right now"
"its that i need to experience SOMETHING"
"what is it you need"
"its not that i need to experience everything right now"
"Experiencing everything doesn't happen all at once"
"The time frames for happiness maybe aren't realistic"
"but i cant"
"i want to experience everything"
"i want to be able to live life literally to the fullest"
"i dont know who i am"
"i mean im crying at work.  thank god for cubicles"
"you do sound very depressed"
"i have to choke it down"
"Then your expectations of what life is are unrealistic. Kind of like your expectations of relationships. You need to shrink your ideas."
"like bread"
"ive been surviving on what i can force myself to eat"
"i havent been able to eat for about a week now if not longer"
"the things that seem to make me happy, or i think they will make me happy, are things i cannot do or have"
"It's very difficult"
"you CAN fix unhappiness"
"well klonopin is not going to help depression. Unhappiness is different. It can't be fixed with a pill. That is an external problem"
"depression is pretty heavy.  unhappiness."
"negative intense feelings"
"intense feelings about this situation"
"just general intensity is what it seems like"
"you seem to be having trouble naming the feelings you're experiencing"
"because you aren't experiencing anxiety"
"I know why"
"i dont know if klonopins work anymore"
"like breaking point insane"
"I know you are."
"but im going insane"
"it's good for me"
"i mean i love chris and i need to live with him"
"I know."
"its just suffocating"
"i know i hate it"
"It's just when you live with someone, that's hard to do sometimes"
"I get that"
"was to have a friend separate from chris, so you could feel independent in some way"
"the idea of this"
"I mean I dno't htink he'll care anyway"
"And if he's your friend he won't care"
"theres nothing i could say that wouldnt make me sound crazy"
"you have a point"
"you can handle it"
"i dont even know if he would be comfortable talking about anything deeper than smoking weed and animals"
"letting him know"
"I think he's overwhelmed. In the infancy of your friendship he was pulled into some sort of situation. I suggest talking to him about it in a non-aggressive way"
"like he's afraid of me and just wants me to leave him alone"
"he seems like he's trying to push me away from him and towards chris which is very annoying.  i can control my own relationships.  he's always mentioning marriage and babies in conjunction with me and chris"
"he's just worried that he's interfering or making things hard because he's a good friend"
"there's nothing ""to"" that"
"he's a very upfront, surface kind of guy"
"read it at the surface"
"Dude that sounds like him worrying about his effect on your relationship"
"everything is ruined"
"i went to see trevor the other morning and he was all like, oh i thought chris was going to be with you does he know youre here?"
"no i dont even have that any more michael"
"you have no obligation"
"you have control over tha5t"
"You can still hang with trevor without chris"
"its like im not there"
"and when trevor and chris are together"
"i will never get to spend time with trevor without chris"
"now that chris likes trevor"
"He may like him, which is more than he felt before, so it may look like he momentarily likes him more"
"trevor doesn't like chris mroe than you"
"what was that last thing"
"wait what"
"i just hate myself"
"so there goes that"
"also i think trevor likes chris more than me"
"im so depressed"
"im useless"
"i might as well shoot myself"
"and if im not being of use to someone i look up to"
"i feel like im comprised only of what other people think of me"
"i also feel like i have no inner self"
"i cannot allow myself to be happy"
"thats my problem"
"i cant be happy"
"What's goin on"
"but im at the end of my rope"
"i know you already know this"
"i dont know why"
"i cannot be happy"
"That's fantastic"
"Well we had a loop hole but I guess Dunbar animal hospital is taking pity and going to treat her"
"Okay cool beans"
"ill tell you ina  bit"
"we found a loop hole"
"If it does heal on trevor watch he may have a painful deformity"
"A dog with broken bones is serious business"
"because it just happened before work"
"right now we havent had time to assess"
"he will do whatever he thinks is best"
"dude those dogs are his babies"
"probably just a broken shoulder"
"no i mean"
"It's IN SOO MUCH pain"
"Dude kill it"
"trevor called me at 8 this morning.  one of his dogs got off her leash and got hit by a car, probably broken bones, she's in his garage right now and he's at work like 10 feet from me and we're trying to help him save and keep this dog"

"and then i said he skates to work"
"HE IS A LIAR I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM"
"What is everyone's deal hahahaha"
"and he was like"
"dude i told him that trev said that he's talked to josh before"
"I WANT YOU TO HAVE THEM"
"He doesn't want you to have friends either"
"God damn haha"
"Is it???"
"he's started to lash out at me when i dont pay attention to him"
"I was hoping you would. *friends*"
"josh's jealousy is getting out of hand dude"
"im sorry but dont apologize because im laughing so hard"
"I am sorry for what I have just done and what it will do"
"and since he blocked you, you can call him on it lol"
"you would enjoy his raging jealousy right now"
"dude...josh on my status"
"he has been using sick days, and he came in today and they changed his schedule without telling him, and they told him to leave.  then he had to go get food pantry food, but didnt have time to do that and catch a bus back to his house, so i helped him get some food and get back home"
"What happened to him at work"
"trevor is taking Pretzel, the sand boa because we cant get him to eat.  and i helped him go get organic food pantry stuff lol.  he's much worse off than i thought but he deserves some help.  theyre fucking him at work too.  politics, like usual."
Great
"chris is totally fine with it and so is trevor, neither are being weird"
"ive been helping trev out"
"chris trevor and i are all very cool"

"I'll help"
"Workin on it"
"i need to speak with a BPD counselor asap"
"okay lol catchya latahh"
"You haven't known him for long so it's hard to say anything honestly. But I've gotta get ready for work. I'll talk to you once I get there. It's gonna be slow lol"
"and just be normal, if i can"
"ill just make it seem like i think chris is crazy and im just not going tp push or address the issue"
"yea true"
"Just pretend you aren't a part of that"
"That will make you look crazy if you're avoiding that"
"Don't do that"
"I think trevor ..Like I said.. is very nonjudgmental"
"i cant win"
"now i feel almost like im trying to compensate for what he has said about me"
"i know im really trying my hardest but chris kind of shoved me in the deep end"
"That kinds stuff"
"Share common interests"
"Just in the begining"
"The best thing you can do for a new friendship is keep it very surface"
"i think he was trying to maybe show him up?"
"he DEEP CLEANED hitler's shitty tank"
"""does she wanta  salad?"""
"""doesnt she need some water?"""
"he sort of suggested that chris wasnt taking proper care of animals?  like, verrry slightly"
"also while he was at the house"
nothing
"i messaged him aboutt he martin thing and asked him to ignore it, just to see if he would respond to me"
"and then yesterday i offered him a ride to work and to smoke one day (didnt specify a day) and he just didnt respond"
"sometime she doesnt and hes like yea lets hang out"
"like, more often than naught"
"He ignores me sometimes"
"I just"
"I don't think he cares"
"Even if he does"
"These are all of the things I see, and I don't understand HOW he is that way, but i want him to be my friend and I'm afraid he thinks I'm crazy now"
Also
"I find this fascinating"
"He's the opposite of me. Grounded. Peaceful. Nice. Welcoming. Laid back personality. Not quick to react. Knows exactly what he wants without obsessing over it. Is very trusting it seems. Incredibly non judgmental. Overall stable. Open to new experiences more than I would be. He seems completely free of anxiety and inhibition. He seems totally fine even though he had a horrible break up. He is ""thankful"" even when he has a lot to complain about."
"Here's why I like trevor"
Also
"So he stood up for your friendship"
"That seems like trevor standing his ground. Like...""you can't control who I'm friends with. "" 
You talked about chris doing thay yesterday and it probably bugged him"
"That thay whple trevor vs chris thing yesterday"
"I want to say first"
Well
"I can talk for a minute"
"but i understand, we can talk about it later if youre up to it"
"i hope youre not having to work right now because im concerned about this a little"
"and vise versa"
"because that's partially why you were there, also because it was a lot of fun and i knew you'd ;like him"
"now tell me your full trevor analysis from yesterday pls"
"it was uncomfortable"
like
"because i mean, when chris threw a little bit of shade at him, trevor threw it right back"
"that chris is not going to ""scare him off"""
"it is very clear from last night"
"i mean"
"trevor is so ""cool"""
"only because"
"well i dont think thats the case"
"Scare him from friendship"
"Like to what"
"I know"
"he made me seem sort of just unreliable and crazy"
"because i mean"
"yea that sort of hurt my feelings"
"Almost like ""watch out for her she's insane"""
Loudly
"He was expressing his anger with you"
"He wasn't just making amends with trevor"
"Look at all of the microagressions"
Also
"It was so awkward to read dude"
...really?
"Sounds like he just wanted to force trevor to say you weren't his type for personal gratification. I will disagree with trevor and say this is NOT a healthy conversation"
"i separated the quotes back and forth"
"there, it starts with chris"
"yo

Hunter brought it to my attention that I was a dick to you at some point yesterday. If so, I apologize. I think you're cool, I'm just a very jealous person and it's hard to gauge what someone's intentions are. I'm sure you understand that.

I... well she mention she thought you had been a dick. I was still teying to figure out what ahe meant

Haha good
I wasnt trying to be one

I had a blast.

She's just over compensating because I think she has a little crush on you.
But that's okay.
You seem to have morals.

Shes deff a heart all in type girl huh.
She be ok
I didnt put that together either though ty.

She's a reckless decision maker sometimes.
I mean I'm not telling you that to make it awkward.
I'm just very aware of it and that's why I may be on edge sometimes.

Yeah I did gather that. I dont think you are. You would know. Ill keep it in mins ty chris.
Mind*

Thanks for being cool about it. I'd like to trust you of course.
Is that something I can do?

I would assume you do with these type texts!
And you followes your nose well friend

Forgive me for not understanding what you mean by that.

You must trust me to have this convo that is a healthy move bro
Im not a wifey snatcher

I appreciate you saying that. I've gotta give you a heads up though. The reason I was hating on Martin so hard yesterday, is that he watches all of hunter's conversations and blabs about it.
So now my entire department heard that ""Chris' girlfriend is fucking around on him with some guy in sales.""

Well I can tell you man that isnt true and wouldnt happen. Im mad at sex my wifey just left me after two years with no car and her puppy and all the bills...
Let them talk! Whats it matter

Yeah I heard about the situation with your girl. They can be cold, man.

Plus hunter isnt my type and already possibly forever wifey for you

The only reason it would matter to me, is because im very proud of hunter. I don't want the entire call center to think she's a whore. Not a good look.
Either way, I think you're a solid dude and I don't mind you guys hanging out. I wouldnt try to control that. She really doesnt have much to do when I'm at work, so I appreciate her having someone to chill with.
Oh, and thanks for being so nice to her. She told me about how considerate you were of her caffeine sensitivity.

Well if martin has the power to actually convey that fuck people are atupid! It should be cruahed soon cause people who know me wont buy that and we will all be around each other there

Yeah im sure it'll fade pretty quickly"
fuck
"let me revise it i guess"
"Did chris say you were not his type"
"I don't even know who is who"
"yo

Thanks for being cool about it. I'd like to trust you of course.
Is that something I can do?

I would assume you do with these type texts!

And you followes your nose well friend
Forgive me for not understanding what you mean by that.

You must trust me to have this convo that is a healthy move bro

Im not a wifey snatcher
I appreciate you saying that. I've gotta give you a heads up though. The reason I was hating on Martin so hard yesterday, is that he watches all of hunter's conversations and blabs about it.
So now my entire department heard that ""Chris' girlfriend is fucking around on him with some guy in sales.""

Well I can tell you man that isnt true and wouldnt happen. Im mad at sex my wifey just left me after two years with no car and her puppy and all the bills...

Let them talk?! Whats it matter
Yeah I heard about the situation with your girl. They can be cold, man.

Plus hunter isnt my type and already possibly forever wifey for you
The only reason it would matter to me, is because im very proud of hunter. I don't want the entire call center to think she's a whore. Not a good look.
Either way, I think you're a solid dude and I don't mind you guys hanging out. I wouldnt try to control that. She really doesnt have much to do when I'm at work, so I appreciate her having someone to chill with.
Oh, and thanks for being so nice to her. She told me about how considerate you were of her caffeine sensitivity.

Well if martin has the power to actually convey that fuck people are atupid! It should be cruahed soon cause people who know me wont buy that and we will all be around each other there
Yeah im sure it'll fade pretty quickly"

"No new photos when I go through his albums"
"I see a wall post about a gop debate from friday"

"*no posts*"
"Maybe he is just taking a break from Facebook because his hereditary arthritis is flaring up in his hands"
"Don't see the status"

"He's a vulture"
"(Not a sarcastic right)"
"Josh has been coming into me sort of hahaha"
Right.
"I don't want to check on his shit at all. Whatever makes him happy he can go for it. I trust him anyways."
"That's not an open relationship. It's just you feel suffocated and are getting space. He needs his own space too. This has to be a two way street. Obviously don't be secretive, but you can have your ""own business"""
"No he was going to do the open relationship and maybe kill himself and I was like nope not doing this hahahaha"
"Basically an open relationship with no sex I guess. I don't know how this is going to work but I have to make it work.  I took back all of my private space, yes."
"He's giving permission for you to have personal space is what I'm taking haha"
"Wait so help me understand the agreement lol"
"Be nice to him though, he's like a baby."
"Because he just suffocates me"
"Going with Chris to help Trevor find a car tomorrow.  We came to a sort of agreement. He can't read my shit, and I don't have to ask permission to go somewhere and I can ask him to stay here if I want."
"That's understanding"
"I have not met a kinder person hahaha"

"I know"
"i feel so guilty for it"
"Not your fault. That happens"
"I.e. you aren't attracted to him which is kind of caused by his lack of care"
"so what if i want to do something, maybe sexual, with someone who takes care of themselves"
"i try and try to help him but he wont listen"
"chris is balding, he has scoliosis, he doesnt take care of his body."

"And you then realized you deserved to be with someone who makes you as happy as you make them,  because of his gestures"
"even knew about a ton of them"
"and was IN LOVE with them"
"and he came and saw the animals"
"dammit quotes"
"and he was like ""oh im sorry, i should have offered you something else, and he took it back in the kitchen for me"""
"and then i mentioned having a caffeine sensitivity"
"with coconut milk"
"he made me organic french brewed coffee"
"he radiates warmth and he DOES things, he goes and protests things he doesnt believe in and he goes on hikes every day"
"I've heard lol"
"but trevor has a house near TM, i think its his mom's but i also think he owns it?  im not sure.  anyways.  he is the kindest, most considerate, soft spoken, intelligent person"
"and mine even"
"according to chris' standards"
"of course, disclaimer, i did nothing even almost wrong"
"Okay sure"
"let me walk you through yesterday"
"both of the 2nd and some of the 3rd"
"I see. Did you just have this epiphany or is this a thing you've really thought about/is there some kind of game plan"
"i feel like it is time for me to get out of my relationship with chris.  not necessarily jump into anything else, but im just not happy.  and im not happy thinking about leaving him either.  it's pretty upsetting."
"You know that's not what I do. Let's hear it friend."
"please dont persecute me for this and please try to understand"
"What's going on"
"Sorry I just got up. Slept in."
"im assuming youre working"
"i need someone to vent to and you and josh are the only two people i can talk to"
"Yea I'll dance around it's I'll generalize. Gotta go, wish me luck"
"Yeah I wouldn't bring specific examples up because it's very offensive but you could vaguely mention something like that"
"Elijah is coming with us after work so Chris can chill about by then. I have to be considerate but the same time his morals were verrry lose when we started dating. I didn't even bitch about him going to a stripe club and getting black out drunk"
"Dude I dunno. You just have to work through this with him"
Well
Ok
Haha
"I hope the latter"
"Figuratively lolol"
"Literally or figuratively"
"He is strangling me"
"Chris is damaged and insecurity is a side effect without a prescription solution. You need to find ways to work through your relationship. You just haven't quite found one yet."
"Dude I'm just so confused and overwhelmed but honestly I do not care. I know I did nothing wrong."
"To you"
"No I'm saying it wouldn't matter if beck guy was male or female"
"Not really because I don't care.  People are human. I believe humans make and learn from mistakes. I have."
"If he was a chick you would feel the same way"
"Which is awesome"
"This dude actually loves animals!  That's rare to find and I enjoy showing off my collection"
"I've realized recently that me intervening would be chaotic"
"I'm not and here's why. I'm also his friend and I'm not crossing that line."
"I am with him 90% of the time"
"Dude please talk to him please"
"Oh no"
"Chris asked if anything weird was happening, told him exactly what I was doing with who, and now he's flying off the handle"
"Which is not a bad thing, it is rare."
"i just found a friend who likes reptiles, that's so rare here"
"He will never believe that I didn't do inappropriate things"
"But he will lose his mind"
"If he asks who you're with you need to tell him"
"Question. Is it bad that in hanging out with beck (Trevor) and I don't want Chris to know?  He would persecute me for it no matter what."
"He's actually intelligent and understands my issues! This is so new to me lol"
"I know dawg np"
"John is the best thank you so so so so much"
"later bro"
"Dude I gtg"
"Oh TODAY"
"Are tou not at work haha"
"used to work at a rescue place"
"turns out he's very informed on reptiles"
"also im hanging out with beck today"
"gotta shower and head over there, ill let you know how it goes"
"okay thats a gud plan"
"Tell him you aren't a hard drug user. Or say something that implies you smoke without saying it. If he asks obviously you say yes."
"should i tell him weed or no?"
"he's probably going to ask if im ""on any drugs or medications"""
"i meant to ask"
"haha i know dis"
"You have an appt today yay"
"hi there"
Hey

"I've gotta go"
"Slam hand"

"It gets you"
"Don't scheme"
"or maybe"
"do i just ignore him from now on?"
Lol
"Being a decent friend sometimes is the definition of being a shady friend"
"and then sometimes he treats me like garbage because he gets jealous and thinks itll make me like him"
"because sometimes he is a decent friend"
"i dont want to also be a child and tell him to never talk to me again"
"Sorry was in a basement and no messages sent haha"
"But you obviously know this"
"He's a huge child"
"what do you mean? lol"
"He doesn't get you"
"im shaking from anger, i want to tell him to never spoeak to me again"
"after earlier her told me it's ""retarded"" for me to avoid black sheep because the employees harrass me to buy alcohol to prove that im not 21, because i tried to pass as 21 ONE TIME"
"lordmacbayne:  you're too harsh.

 lordmacbayne:  fair enough.
 me:  im tired of being talked to as if im inferior to these fucking rejects

Me: Well, I woke up late God: Yes Me: My car took forever to start God: Okay Me: at lunch they made my sandwich wrong & I had to wait God: Huummm Me: On the way home, my phone went DEAD, just as I picked up a call God: All right Me: And on top of it all off, when I got home ~I just want to soak my feet in my new foot massager & relax. BUT it wouldn't work!!! Nothing went right today! Why did You do that? God: Let me see, the death angel was at your bed this morning & I had to send one of My Angels to battle him for your life. I let you sleep through that Me (humbled): OH GOD: I didn't let your car start because there was a drunk driver on your route that would have hit you if you were on the road. Me: (ashamed) God: The first person who made your sandwich today was sick & I didn't want you to catch what they have, I knew you couldn't afford to miss work. Me (embarrassed):Okay God: Your phone went dead because the person that was calling was going to give false witness about what you said on that call, I didn't even let you talk to them so you would be covered. Me (softly): I see God God: Oh and that foot massager, it had a shortage that was going to throw out all of the power in your house tonight. I didn't think you wanted to be in the dark. Me: I'm Sorry God God: Don't be sorry, just learn to Trust Me.... in All things , the Good & the bad. Me: I will trust You. God: And don't doubt that My plan for your day is Always Better than your plan. Me: I won't God. And let me just tell you God, Thank You for Everything today. God: You're welcome child. It was just another day being your God and I Love looking after My Children... REPOST if you Believe in HIM Worth posting."

"Andrea DiGregorio Brilliant ! It reminds me of three Christmases ago. I had just gotten a new iPhone and Brandon had just gotten a new iPod. We sat next to each other on the couch for three hours that night. Playing with our new technology. Both of us totally absorbed in what we were doing. And when we were done this is what Brandon said, with a sweet irony, ""it's been great spending time with you Mom.""
May 6 at 2:43pm Â· Like Â· 1

Ian Jessee i enjoyed spending time"
"and here is the first comment. Keep in mind, she is talking about time with her son."
"he posted this video that everyone is sharing about BLAH BLAH BLAH THERE'S SO MUCH TEXTING BUT NOOOOO COMMMMMUNICATING *YOUNG PEOPLE*"
ok
"YES YES YOU KNOW I DO"
"WANT TO SEE"
"IAN JESSE THINGS"
OMG
"yea thats perfect"
"is that a good temp?"
"It's about 74-75 upstairs now. about like the rest of the house"
"because if it gets too hot and no one can tend to him he could die"
"yea i mean you may want to just leave him downstairs somewhere"
haha
"I had to bring him downstairs while matts room was at like 95 degrees"
"as long as he stays at a good temperature he'll be the easiest thing matt has ever taken  care of lol"
"but he started eating and got a good bit more active"
"He was sendentary"
"yay thats awesome to hear :D"
"sunny ate the fruit mash yesterday, which is good. We should be getting the minerall tomorrow"
"yea ill do everything i can for the little guy."
ok
"I would assume"
"and thats a slippery slope"
"because they can get dehydrated and lose electrolites"
explain
"Okay like three diffrerent places have said something about pedialite. WHY"
"hahaha yea my wild caught anoles are sort of like that, they eat well and everything but theyre sort of skinny.  i think i just need to feed them more often because theyre acting fine."
"I to get freaked out over colors. I ALWAYS FORGET that he does change colors. I know black spots mean he's stressed/something is up...but I looked at him and was like ""WHY IS HE LIKE PALE GREEN"" and then I realized he was at the bottom of the enclosure with the grass that was pale green compared to him"
"could be a lot of things.  with wild caught animals they norm\ally stay thinner than captive bred ones.  so he will probably not ever fatten up too much but getting him to optimum health should be fairly easy if he's not doing too bad already"
"because there are crickets from yesterday he hasn't eaten."
"but he could also be sick"
"which isn't like too bad I don't think. It could just be hot, he could be going after a certain cricket, or he could be exploring"
"When I went up there he was at the bottom of the enclosure"
"but yeah"
"My mom pretty much insisted on matt getting this one, so I'm not blaming him. And so many resources online tell you completely different things I couldn't expect matt to know what's what"
"\if he wants"
"i can keep him for a few nights and see if i can get him back on track"
"the thing about buying animals is you cant take anyone's word on it unless they have a ton of experience with that species.  youve gotta do research to make sure everything is right.  but it's a common error.  ill help any way i can."
"I would appreciate that. Matt has said a million times if chaos dies he's going to give up. And I don't want him to. We just WERE NOT given proper instructions for care"
"i have that stuff, you can come over with him after work if you want.  but yea im still sick and nauseous from anxiety"
"I don't think he's going to live"
"Where can I get that thing to clear chaos of parasites"
dude
"What time did you go to bed"
"I'm still hearing anxiety"
"yea it's like if i hear chris breath funny it registers as a scary noise and my heart starts racing and i get nauseous"
"But that's happened to me"
"Really bad anxiety"
"Just anxiety"
"and i cant sleep because i have nothing for it"
"i dont know what's wrong with me but i think i have some form of mild night terrors or sleep paralysis.  i get so paranoid i think something is going to appear and scare the shit out of me, and it paralyses me with fear"

"jeeez maria -.-"
"I am going to go spritz chaos with some water. The water in the bottle is like boiling haha i need to replace it"
"That makes sense."
"yea its good that the lamps were unplugged.  honestly on days that are hot like this it would hurt to turn off the basking lamps."
"I guess considering the temperature sky rocketed that wasn't so bad"
"and like all of the lamps came unplugged"
"I am SO MAD about that"
"by tonight the temp should be back down in the mid 70s"
"Yeah I just misted him."
"but for chaos the only thing i can recommend is to keep gut loading the crickets with fruit and make sure he gets misted when it's hot like this, and of course on other days as well."
"ORDERED IT WILL B HERE SAT."

"so does john have experience treating BPD?  im assuming he knows about your grandma lolol"
"yayyy ^.^"
"that will move things along"
"but they will definitely be able to move your records from PS to damous"
"so you can go into more detail"
"Yeah. And those kinds of things will be reached ,through a series of questions most likely"
"i have intense mood swings often resulting in anger, i am incredibly anxious, i have co-dependent tendencies and i am unreasonably hard on myself and those around me"
"ahhhh okay i see what youre saying"
"The symptoms are what's most important."
"listing relative disorders. List all the issues you're having, even if you know they fall into certain disorders. Going in with a list of things you have can be off putting and confuse the diagnostic process"
"Here's what you should avoid with any psychiatrist, because you have to remember they are human and complete objectivism is impossible...."
"and thats what causes the anger"
"im self criticizing to almost an OCD level.  and im that critical of others as well."
"The more direct you can be about exactly what you're feeling the better he can help. So that's good that you're aware"
"okay good stuff.  and yea ill just tell him that i have had anxiety all of my life, which is easily tamed down, but that my anger and mood swings are the nastier problem"
"they can transfer your information over with your permission"
"is tell him you were at process strategies, and who you were seeing"
"Best thing you can do"
"Well here's the thing, he can help you tackle the smaller things, like intense mood fluctuations and anger."
"Huh okay...I don't think I've ever had a psychiatrist understanding enough to prescribe something for BPD, or to say that i have BPD.  how should i approach him with that situation?  just tell him that i tested very highly for it?"
"That's true. And there are pharmacological things that can be done to help with BPD. Don't discount that. I don't know what john will prescribe, but chances are it will be to tackle all of your problems."
"Hm okay.  My BPD is something that I need to work on with myself, but i need someone who can help me deal with the anxiety because if i have anxiety nothing is getting fixed."
"The only good doctors there were John, who left, and Dr. P, who left for a better job. I went to both of them. Dr. P was the person I worked with after I had that mental breakdown. She is really good"
"It doesn't surprise me that they fucked you over"
"Yeah that's true."
"awesome stuff.  thank you again.  i need to call process strategies one last time and tell them not to send me any more bills."
"they should"
"also they should have my old files if he works with damous"
"i will do just that"
"remember to call john's office after work and at least leave a message"
yes

"you should have a *graceful* chameleon"
"so with that information"
awesome
"""The cage should be misted at least twice a day, drying out completely between misting sessions. This raises relative humidity as well as stimulates your chameleon to want to drink. Water can be provided by means of a dripper (not a waterfall or water bowl). The dripper should be placed on top of the cage so that the water droplets drip down and accumulate on plant leaves. Other watering options include manual and automated misting sytems. Chameleons do not recognize standing water as a drinking source."""

"Then don't do it. Keep trying. It's about whether the benefits of making a change outweigh the pain"
"even thinking about what i would do bothers me"
"if i have a back up plan that makes me feel like ive already got one foot out the door"

"Not having some way to retreat is causing more paib"
"You need to have a backup plan"
"That's the problem"
"i dont know what i would do"
"but if i were forced to leave chris"
"im not okay with this situation"
"In writing and read it back...The question is are you OK with what you're reading"
"but michael you know ive done that like 3 times already"
"I mean lay all the facts on the table"
"That makes sense"
"its that he doesnt do enough"
"its not that he does NOTHING"
"is largely caused by him not pulling his weight"
"and i dont think he understands that all of this stress"
"ive tried talking to chris"
like
"The situation definitely isnt"
"And i don't want to give you real advice because if it went wrong you would internally blame me"
"the situation is not great"
"because that must mean"
"even though he's biased his advice matches up with the situation, which worries me"
"He is"
"he is biased"
"but im like, no"
"and its actually good"
"hes giving me this advice"
like
"I see what you mean"
"is that josh has been waiting for me to leave chris and thats never going to happen, but chris is kind of forcing me to think about that"

"or, one of the parts"

"and i really want a burrito, like so bad"
"I know"
"but now im just upset on a daily basis"
"i used to not need it really, only when i was sad"
"like, i cant go a day without weed"
"im a pretty depressed person recently"
"yea im definitely not fighting you on that"
"Rather than deep personal issues"
"I mean if you were happy we would just be talking about idiotic shit all day"
"Yeah it is. I don't dislike chris. I think you love him but you aren't happy like you used to be. I'm not telling you what you are, but this is more of an observation. You aren't super happy"
"its all riding on me"
"i just dont know what to do, and no one can tell me what to do either"
"I don't discount joshs work ethic"
"i told josh all my issues, and he said, you know the christian serenity prayer?  that."
"Work and save"
"THAT is basically how people act now a days"
"Like most others"
"He's just being a responsible hard working adult"
"But like realistically"
"That is respectable"
"he just works"
"he doesnt splurge"
"he saves all his income taxes"
"He is a workaholic and does everything he can to make and save money"
"but the fact that Josh of all people is a harder worker than chris upsets me"
"its not even directed at you lol"
"dont take this in the wrong way"
gahhh
"its just like"
"I have a SIMILAR issue with bella but my life isn't riding on it"
"But sometimes isn't good enough. Although sometimes can distract you from the larger issue"
"I know"
"and does what he needs to, sometimes"
"he does what he's told, sometimes"
"kind of meh"
"and chris is just"
"and i dont mean to say this as if ive been looking elsewhere but there are so many hard working men around here, thats one thing WV has going for it, hard working dudes"
"You are pretty stuck dude."
"yea i really dont know what to do"
"When do I stop"
"How much is too much"
"That's like one of those ""life's big questions"""
"and when you are overworked, what do you even do?"
"something like that.  it just makes me think every day, how hard are you supposed to work on a relationship and on living with someone until youre working harder than you should be?"
"You're right. And I feel like it's causing you to resent chris a little bit but then you remember you don't resent him and feel guilty?"
"i mean it shouldnt be my responsibility but if hes not going to compensate then i have to, its not really something im choosing to do, this is something i have to do"
"The real world is not so forgiving"
"It may not be but it's not your responsibility to compensate."
"i dont know, i know that i work harder but sometimes i wonder if thats really his fault."
"That emoticon is off"
": /"
"You work hard and he doesn't. He should have taken that position :/"
"I don't know what to tell you"
Sigh
"occurrences, also there is no full time slot for the hours he works, he would have to choose a different shift or move to a different department, which he had a chance to do with josh but he missed out on"
Oh
Why
"hits not that simple sadly"
no
"How? He can't just wait for openings and apply for then?"
"im stuck here"
"never going to happen"
"Yeah..If chris could find a full time slot that would be good at some point"
"because of chris"
"and thats literally the only type of place i could work"
"well i mean, finding a place that would let me work overnight is not going to be possible"
Sadly
"There are few places that don't test anymore"
"thisis truly saddening"
"I'm sorry"
Yeah
"i guess i cant get the job"
But
BUY
"i cant stop smoking, i will need to be hospitalized if so"
"They will find it in my pee. They had to send it away because it was positive for something"
Haha
"I advise you not to do this unless you can stop smoking long enough"
"i may have to rethink this"
"hmm...they would find xanax in your pee which wuldnt be good for me"
"They stand right outside the door and listen to you pee, it's temperature sensitive to assure that you peed, and then they send it to a lab if there's anything fishy. You have to tell them you're on klonopin but if they don't find It in the screening...."

HOWEVER, I was FULLY AWARE, that I was being beaten to death even though I seemed to be neither alive or dead. Some ""force"" was just beating me to the ground. I couldn't see it, or smell it/taste it/feel it/hear it. I was just aware of what was happening to me, and I could not escape. This infinitely white room was my only solace. I just kept moving, or doing what I thought was moving, away from whatever was touching me. It was like, I knew I was being beaten to the ground and I could sense something, but I completely lacked the human experience required in order to acknowledge it properly."
well
ok

"I ask, because I'm going to find you someone who is specialized in dialectical talk therapy who takes your insurance completely. Or a pyschiatrist who has a subspecialty"
"well i cant talk to a therapist because when i start talking about my problems i just started crying to the point of not being able to speak and then eventually hyperventilating"
"do you think a therapist or a psychiatrist would help you more?"
okay

"take tylenol"
"maybe try to drain it?"
"well thats an educated decision"
"so I've decided that since i'm not nauseous or sick feeling, I'm going to disinfect it and apply cold compresses and antibiotic ointment. If it starts to look worse...I'll go somewhere. I just can't afford the doctor haha"

"hes a fucking idiot"
"yea but he has too many occurences to switch departments because he takes days off for no reason, and plus josh already offered him a FT posiotion and chris revealed to me today that he thinks if he had taken the job that josh would have just fired him"

You can't change a person's true nature. Both of us are type a personalities in our own lives respectively.  I understand your feelings completely."
"i just dont understand how a person could sit around and just let filth pile up around them and not notice or care"

"Michael, not sure where you get your stories from but when you are reviewing this text with others maybe you can figure it out.

No one speaks to me tha t way. Additionally, in doing that, you have done it for the last time. I'll keep this one for a while to remind me of the reasons life takes it's turns.

The manipulation continues and it's the proof of explanation for anyone who wonders.

I owe you no explanation for anything other than this. When peopl e lie, cheat, and steal, and couldn't borrow a nickel even if they had a dime as collateral, it speaks loud to the character. Someday, when you are succe ssful and are sitting around with your own kids, you may regret the decisions you made on how to communicate with me. Your brother has begged me to talk to you in the past make  you spend time with him so I'm glad you are close to him now. Maybe you can make him understand that he can make it in life with out constant overview and control from others. He needs to understand that.

One important thing to remember and you can go back to believing whatever yo u want from here.

I love you and will always do my best to help you get to where you need to be. I know you will do well in life and I hope to see you s ometime when you decide to stop letting the ones who started this path continue on it. That is the path of hatred and discontent, jealousy etc. ya know, god would have guided people differently, it has always made me wonder why he didn't. Judgement is the true test for all people who proclaim faith. And, he who judges is trying to get the attention off of his own problems and sins........ Bueno nochas,"
"and paranoid"
"he is also hyper religuous for some reason"
"And keep in mind"
"he says this"
"FIVE AM"
"at like"
"This morning"
"I was like fuck off ass hole, matt's not stupid enough to be manipulated by anyone. He's actually smarter than you. I'm able to tolerate anything except treating matt poorly."
"what a loon"
"matt hadn't called him in a long time, and he finally answered one of my dads calls and admitted that he ""didn't want to speak with him."" my dad automatically started yelling, accused him of mutiny, asked to speak with my mom and accused her of conspiracies against him AGAIN"

"me:  martin's trying to get me to buy some acid
ive always wanted to experience it, but i also hate psychadelics, so it's a no for me
 Sent at 2:50 PM on Saturday
 lordmacbayne:  you know, i probably should.
 Sent at 2:58 PM on Saturday
 me:  should what?
 Sent at 3:00 PM on Saturday
 lordmacbayne:  try acid at some point.
 me:  are you serious or fucking with me?
 lordmacbayne:  i don't really want to
but i probably should before i die.
 me:  well if you ever decide its the time for that, let me know, because i refuse to trip by myself and i dont know anyone else that would trip with me and not mess with me for fun
but you should probably, like, hit a joint once before you drop acid
haha
no one goes from 0 to acid and enjoys it."
"okay thats a fair trade"
"In exchange I will send you more ian jesse"
HAHAHA
ok
"*picks flesh from teeth*"
"you will enjoy this i think"
"let me show you the conversation, hahahaha"
"that is incredibly true and ive never thought about that before"

"he is being wayyy too nice to me"
"because recently he is not himself"
"i think josh decided he would try something edgy to get in closer with me.  i think he would actually try something if it would give him an opportunity to connect with me on some weird level."
"TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL"
"but here's how i feel"
"you may be right, most likely"
also
"okay well im glad you dont care because i also know it's decently harmless and im only trying half a blotter tab anyways"
haha
"another reason why I don't care"
"also lsd is DEFINITELY not additive"
"One, you're justifying yourself and YOU KNOW YOU DONT HAVE TO DO THAT WITH ME. I especially won't judge you for LSD. They fucking use it to treat combat veterans haha.


Two, Josh is NOT going to try acid. He is an introvert and not open to anything new at heart. He just wants you to think he's ""edgy."" He's not and you know it. Don't be confused by his false sense of openness. It isn't real. haha"
haha
"go ahead and shame me first"
"Okay two things"
"p.s. the only reason i would buy any is because i know for a fact its real and not a research chem that could kill me"
"all of a sudden, josh is interested in trying acid because i said i might buy some and he wants me to save some for him for ""when he decides he's ready"""

ok
"I googled that paragraph"
Dude
"here, he sent us this"
"Nearly every ancient civilization has some sort of art depicting giant reptilian creatures. Petroglyphs, artifacts, and even little clay figurines found in North America resemble modern depictions of dinosaurs. Rock carvings in South America depict men riding diplodocus-like creatures and, amazingly, bear the familiar images of triceratops-like, pterodactyl-like, and tyrannosaurus rex-like creatures. Roman mosaics, Mayan pottery, and Babylonian city walls all testify to manâs trans-cultural, geographically unbounded fascination with these creatures. Sober accounts like those of Marco Poloâs Il Milione mingle with fantastic tales of treasure-hoarding beasts. In addition to the substantial amount of anthropic and historical evidences for the coexistence of dinosaurs and man, there are physical evidences, like the fossilized footprints of humans and dinosaurs found together at places in North America and West-Central Asia.
Marco Polo wrote of his travels to the province of Karajan and reported on huge serpents, which at the fore part have two short legs, each with three claws. ""The jaws are wide enough to swallow a man, the teeth are large and sharp, and their whole appearance is so formidable that neither man, nor any kind of animal can approach them without terror.""
Books even tell of Chinese families raising dragons to use their blood for medicines and highly prizing their eggs. It is interesting that the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac are all animals--eleven of which are still alive today. But is the twelfth, the dragon merely a legend or is it based on a real animal-- the dinosaur? It doesn't seem logical that the ancient Chinese, when constructing their zodiac, would include one mythical animal with eleven real animals."

"tell me thats ian jessee's words"
"Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;
Thou mine inheritance, now and always;
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all."
"O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed,

Refrain:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin;

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!"

"so that is what I judge him by"
yes
HAHA
"his physical age is more apparent to the observer"
BUT
"obviously he's emotionally younger"
"Emotional age and physical age are very different"
"and thats not his fault"

"simply because"
"you know, i give him about an 8-9 year age grace"
hahahahaha
"or post-teen"

"if i could work weekends and get like 50 hours i'd be doing better than i am here"
"I've got 24 hours a week guaranteed, because I'm part time, but I'll definitely sign up for more"
"that is just SO amazing"
"it's pretty flexible there"
"you can"
"whenever you want to sign up for an extra shift"
like
"but it's soawesome that you can work per diem"
"or something"
"so i could work like nights and days wekends"
"and yea i want to work extra onw eekends if possible too"
hahahaha
"but you will win"
YES
"so a few applicants...does that mean we will have to have a battle to the job?"

"I'd work  weekend nights every once and a while"
"they are lazy and idiots"
hahaha
"ill work any hours for increased pay"
no
"well people are damned idiots"
haha
"no they dont"
"that's why they pay more"
lol
"i wasnt sure if people tried to hog the night hours or not"
"and im so glad no one wants to work nights"
"okay thats awesome"
"so there is a large time frame here"
"My mom said there are quite a few applicants (she just called me so I asked about it), and also said that they LOVE people who want to work nights because no one will do it haha. I was like NO RUSH NOW, hunter has to get everything worked out at ticketmaster...lol....but she said they should call you in like a week to SET UP an interview"

"im almost afraid of like...walking around in a hospital at night"
"rat people from the sewer"
"i hope the night crew isnt like"
"Yeah that will be nice haha"
"oh good hahaha"
"but my mom said there are enough good employees to where it won't matter. and They take complaints about other employees very seriously (which I am keeping in mind)"
"I was concerned in a similar way hahaha"
"i am SO GLAD i dont have to rely on anyone else for my money when my business takes off"
"Don't get me wrong though"
"thats some really crooked shit haha"
"jesus what the fuck"
"There are a lot of really good BHTs"
"like My moms friend was paid 2,000 a month to supervise the aubstance abuse unit on her own time, and then when she quit thye paid the cheif of staff 10,000 a month to do it"
"well the only thing i guess im worried about is working around BHTs who are total assholes lol"
"A lot of other screwed up financial things that I don't fully understand"
"and everyone else's salary takes a hit because of it"
"the CEO makes like twice what a CEO of a hospital that size should make"
"The hopsital admin is like HUGELY fucked up"
EXACTLY
"theyd be fired"
"if those people werent on work release"
"yea that's highly unprofessional"
huh....
"which seems typical of a work program"
"and then they gradually added more"
"all came at once"
"And this influx of stupid employees"
"Like the way they behave. Like SO vulgar and unprofessional. and some of them don't seem to get that they work at a hospital, and are mean to sick people because they don't udnerstand they're sick. And they're too stupid to understand people are hallucainating and stuff, and fucking yell and shit"
"wow, like what?"
"no one can prove it, and the management wont admit to it. but after some of the things my mom has said that BHTs DO, it's seriously unbelievable, I believe it"
"that's the idea"
"yes they work at highland through a work release program"
lol
"that some of the BHTs are possibly felons?"
"so the theory is"
"this is just a theory  my mom and some other employees have"
however
"like discaplining mentally ill kids and things"
"and there are criminals like MAJORLY screwing up"
"but this is fucking medical care essentially"
"those programs are good in some instances"
HOWEVER
"And so some of the BHTs are assumed to be felons and shit"
"some of the staff think that highland has a work release program, but the uppermanagement wont admit to it"
"is because"
"the reason I said that they'd appreciate you as a BHT"
"it's a running thing between the staff"
hahaha
"Dude my mom has a theory about highland that's like that"
"doesn't sound like that"
"i can only think of one straight white male thats a manager,m and his mom worked here before him so thats how he got in"
"but what's going on at TM"
"affirmative action yada yada yada"
well
"that's a fact"
"that's not a theory"
"and women"
"i bet they get some MASSIVE tax breaks for hiring so many minorities, they probably get an ""equal opportunity"" tax break just for having blacks and cripples and gays in management positions"
"Present it"
but
"i dont know if this has any truth to it"
"i have a thjeory"
haha
"That is so weird"
"usually there's ONE person who hates black people/gays/ect"
"I mean"
"that doesn't happen usually"
"That's really weird"
"hell, our HR manager is a TERRIFYING black woman"
"lots of black managers"
"we have several crippled supervisors"
"a minority"
or
"everyone who gets promoted is either gay or should be"
"it's a running joke"
haha
"dear god"
hahahahahaha
"i swear"
"you have to suck dick"
also
APPAR-ENTLY
"but you have to get shit on your entire life to do it"
"You can"
"yo can make decent money here"
"i told you"
"that is truly insane"
"my mom barely makes more than that"
"than i am"
"and is no more qualified"
"yea dude he's salary"
"he was the queer in high school that probably stumbled upon this BS"
"are you kidding"
"my boss makes like probably 35k a year"
"its very true"
"but it sounds true"
"that is really harsh"
"""as in, the people who work here are just high school drop out who have been given a superiority complex"""
"""I gotsta do what masta says. Masta is so good to me. Masta feed me. Masta taught me how to lock my own cage!"""
"god damn"
"especially the fucking managers"
"as in, the people who work here are just high school drop out who have been given a superiority complex"

"that is something"
wow
"so thats something"
"i hear we have great health insurance"
"some people work their way into the company, get all buddy buddy with the douchebags who run this shit ship, and then they stay here and try not to step on toes"
hahaha
"I'd be PROACTIVE AS HELL looking for another job"
"based on your description"
"who would want to?"
"not many people here can say that"
"hes been here since day 1"
"dear god"
"like josh has"
"or, you buckle down and prepare to be shit on forever"
"so if you dont like it, you quit"
"because you cant ever actually fix anything here"
"yes it is, that's why people either quit or stay here forever if they dont get fired"
"an endless void"
"it's like"
yep
right
"don't care?"
"NO ONE GIVES A SHIT"
"but the fact is"
"i could complain to our call center director"
exactly
"because you have no one to complain about hr to"
"which is fucking ridiculous"
"at tm it is useless"
"but according to you"
"yeah hr has a purpose"
"but at TM, that's where the juicy gossip is"
"the worst part is, in most companies, i could fix this by going to HR"
damn
"me and martin"
"but he has taken his inch and turned it into a mile, and now i do everyone's work"
"i really did"
"i used to like my boss"
"that's what I've taken from your desciption"
"dude, all i do all day is copy and paste responses.  the only human interaction i have is on FB, and then my annoying coworkers, and my boss being a cunt"
"but you're just give codes out to idiots so your company can rob them blind and then later tease them about it"
"I feel like if you sold something that people actually needed, then customer service would be more validating"
"Either way it's a drag"
"I see"
"OH right okay"
"we are 2nd party"
"those kind of sites"
"they buy from us"
"the third parties are stubhub"
"or,s ometimes, the venue"
"you can go through us"
"i mean, not really"
"there are other services"
"it makes it easier to get tickets, but at what cost?"
technically
"that doesn't NEED to exist"
"a third party"
"that's actually what it is"
"it's a useless intermediary"
"it's useless"
"we do nothing to help anyone"
"its fucked"
"i hate our company"
"is that TM can do whatever they please. And they robbed the people who thought they were getting a deal for the hell of it, when they could've just robbed the people who didn't care"
"im gonna take a quick break, brb"
"the genius of this"
always
yes
"And they continue to do it"
"and everyone who participated int he presales are like HOW ARE YOU GONNA JUST CHANGE THE PRICE I WANT A REFUND BURN IN HELL TICKETMASTER"
"they release the rest of the tickets cheaper than before (most of the time, not always)"
"and then when the general sale hits"
"pay a shit ton of money, end up with shitty seats and a shitty attitude because theyre dumb"
"so people RUSH to get presale tickets"
"so everyone thinks presale tickets are the best seats for SOME FUCKING REASON THAT MAKES NO SENSE"
"they dont educate anyone"
"here it is, this is my theory"
well
"what is the MONETARY BENEFIT"

"THAT LINK OF HANK HILL"
"tjesus god thank you haha finally, i hate the way they diagnose stuff"
"OH MY GOD"
"they are TRICKY to diagnose"
"they're trying to change the diagnosis for personality disorders, because it doesn't make sense. If you don't fit all the categories, what you don't have it? that's so far from the truth haha"
"they just say your tendencies"
"yea i hate that, because they never really outright tell you what you have"
"unlike depression and other things, where there are varying degrees"
"you have it or you don't"
so
"is that they are diagnosed categorically, not dimensionally"
"but the issues with PD's"
"He fits into cluster A personality disorders perfectly"
"He's really paranoid and neurotic"
"i mean i dont think he's totally schizoid but i do see the tendencies, heavily demonstrated by his fear of he and i being anything at all"
"So usually, you can trust me, but not this time."
"HOWEVER, I was just playing a game."
"but I do think josh has some schizoid tendencies.  Seriously."
"OCD is anxiety. The obsessions are anxiety, and the compulsions are what you use to fight the anxiety"
Basically.
hahahaha
"depression without it is bipolar"
"depression with anxiety is borderline"
HAHA
anxiety.
"it's all based on anxeity."
"just slight"
"every mental disorder is basically the same with SLIGHT VARIATION"
"I would be an AWFUL psychologist"
"I mean yeah if I want to. And usually I'm convincing."
"YOU JUST WANT TO GIVE HIM DRUGS'"
"YOURE JUST A PHARMER"
"YOU JUST FIT THEM TO THE SITUATION"
"do your diagnoses even count?"
HAHAHAHA
"I don't really know what he has, I'm just really good at doing this"
"Pick another disorder, I bet I could place it on him perfectly."
"The reason is not a delusion, is because it could be true. So he's not totally crazy."
"this is so strange hahahaha"
"His behavior comes off as control seeking because that's the character he plays in this triangle"
"It's all about maintenance"
"It's not even about control in this situation. It's just that he's thinks he's a part of something that he's not a part of. Your relationship with chris isn't contingent on his actions. But he thinks it is. He's attached special meaning to himself."
"when he doesnt"
"oh okay, so he's trying to be like to ""savior"" of the situation, for me.  as if he's keeping me from leaving chris, but he thinks that he's the one keeping me from it, and that he has control"
"see what I'm getting at"
"If it weren't for him, you and chris wouldn't be together"
"Well yes, that is his part in all of this"
"he does see that chris and i being together is good for me"
"but then again"
"because he is always on MY side, not chris'"
"No i don't think."
"by getting rid of chris?"
"to official weird ones?"
"change his current weird relations with me"
"I mean, It's funy but it's not a joke"
"is he trying to..."
"It's a false idea."
HAHA
"Just like he thinks he's smarter than he is and he's got all of these intersting quirks"
Yeah
"i see"
"Anyone else would not care if you were seen talkign together"
ohhhhh
"that he is in some weird enmeshed relationship with you and chris. that's what his behavior indicates. He plays an ""integral role"" in keeping it together."
"he thinks"
basically
Yes
"basically he is imagining some strange type of relationship with me that doesnt exist, but in some facets it does, and he doesnt want to screw that up because i have fit into some slot in his life and he finds comfort in this strange ""relationship"" somehow"
"OK haha"
"okay let me try to understand this theory haha"
"He thinks he's enmeshed in the situation though"
"Your problems don't involve you and josh speaking to eachother"
"When in reality"
"He can't ""mess it up"""
"Partly that, and because he's attached some mystical thought to it. Like he is so paranoid about even being seen talking to you to begin with. He feels like he's a part of yours and chris's relationship in some way."
golem
hahahaha
"but because hes socially inept"
"so you think he says no, not because he's a dick"
"Like ""no"" 

*golem, golem*"
hahaha
"but ""no"" schizotypally"
"or ""no"" regrettingly"
"""NO"" angrily"
"not just like"
"when you asked him"
"He was SUPER sketchy about it"
"(ideas of reference again)"
"Is that his mental process convinced him that he would be punished for getting involved, even when he had nothing to do with it."
"My theory on that"
Yes
probably
"any other time he would be like COME ON DOWN"
"and he couldnt handle it"
"i wanted to spend time with him when i was upset with chris"
because
"wait...youre right"
"you think it's genuine?"
"hm...i thought that was something he just did to look weird?"
"few close friends"
"bad with relationships"
obsessive
"he lives in solitude"
paranoia
"He has ideas of reference"
"I think it's a safe assumption"
"for some time now"
"very intimately"
"I've known him through one degree of seperation"
"I mean"
hahahahahaha
"(also yes, the brighter the better)"
"thats a HEAVY diagnoses"
"That is my conclusion today."
"has schziotypal personality disorder"
"that josh"
"i was like, that looks nice, but it would be better if it were brighter"
"I think"
"also i think i convinced him to actually dye his hair.  we will see.  i ""coached"" him on his hair hahaha"
"it would be bad"
"i dont know"
"and he could maybe get fired if chris did something"
"josh would look bad"
"(josh's words)"
"but if chris freaked out about a supervisor ""macking on"" his girl"
"because josh cant get fired for anything he's doing or he wants to do"
chris
"i think the main thing is"
"of wanting something that he shouldnt have"
"because he IS guilty"
"so he REALLY cares"
hahahaha
yes
"I remember that"
"GET THE FUCK OUT"
"and he started screaming at martin GET YOUR BULLSHIT OUT OF MY DEPARTMENT"
"martin went over to josh at like 12 AM, they were both here pretty much alone, and he was like ""i heard you and hunter have a date tomorrow"" or something, about brunch"
"I think maybe that sounds familiar"
okay
Wait
"tell me"
NO
"did i tell you how he yelled at martin???"
"they know hes always on the hunt"
hahahahaha
"people know josh"
"and youre wrong dude"
yes
"he is"
"no one would think that"
"are you guys THAT afraid of people assuming you're having a secret affair"
"Why would it matter"
like
"and then i guess people started wondering why he was standing by me, and he just kind of wondered back to his area hahahaha"
hahaa
123GO
"I thought you were giving me clearance to chop that to bits"
"is what he said"
"""123GO"""
"but then he told me i should cut my hair all off and bleach it"
"so i didnt laugh at him"
"its barely noticable"
"a  very pastel pink thing in his haire"
"and he has like"
"i guess he has to head straight out after work so he came over here to talk to me before he left"
ok
"so i have to let you know how it went"
"the weather man told me to"
"i just had an interaction"
"so wait"

"That sounds good."
"mindy is going to be able to get a bank loan thats going to help me SO MUCH, now i can just tell these car dickholes that i want the bottom dollar price and i can pay cash all at once.  thatll help me a lot, then ill just pay back that loan to mindy's bank"

"oh so if youre actually shitty at your job you get punished"
"well I think you're just fired"

"THAT SYSTEM ANNOYS ME"
"they don't give you a demerit"
yeah
hahaha
"thats awesome."
"oh.  well that's just.  common sense."
"like if you're 60 minutes late they subtract that from your pay check"
"explain how they dock the pay?"
"They dock your pay if you're late. No fucking demerits or anything. And they like advanced notice or you being sick if you wanna call off"
"ive been here a year and a half"
"im just so nervous lol"
"do you know how they are with attendance and things?  im never late and i hardly ever call off"
"Yeah highland is much more flexible"
"the reason i didnt go to college (besides me deciding not to) is because they refused to change my schedule to allow it"
"no matter what lol"
"i have to work the same hours every day"
"im just glad ill be working a job with more flexibility than this one"
"if i could work 4 nights, and then get some extra hours during days, that would be awesome"
"im going to see if they allow working 4 ten hour shifts"
"Not sure. I'll let you know"
"they may put me in the same one"
"so do you know when your class is?"
hahahahaha
CHRIST
"Some rich college asshole is yelling at her mom on the phone about her travel visa"
"They do. That's why I haven't taken any they only occur on certain. Days of the month"
"yea thats true.  do they have like...scheduled classes?  because if they havent scheduled one for awhile, they may wait to call me back"
Lol
"It could actually be more than a month"
"We still don't know how long it will be u til they call and you even start"
Haha
"Well and"
"U til theb"
"Just detox and/or formulate a plan"
"So I'll let you know about what goes on"
"You're already this far in"
BUT
"That's what I'm saying. I believe if you would have waited a week or two to apply you could've gotten a head start"
"i dont want to fail and have your mom responsible"
"yea i mean, if they watch me, i may just have to apply some other time."
"I'll let you k ow next week. But detox anyway. This could be a thing where they watch you, or something else so don't just depend on the cheating solely"
Oh
What?
"i dont want to tip off people that imc heating"
"no i dont know if hes okay with any drug use"
"Ask chad about it"
Also
"I've heard of that before"
"a condom, hidden near your nether regions, so they definitely cant see or feel it.  you put a tack in your shoe.  go in the stall, pull out the tack, poke a hole in the condom, let the clean golden urine flow, and then youre done"
"Fucking ask what's his name about the drug test he's worked there like a year!!! Haha"
"You have to tell me what it is now haha"
"chris did it before"
"i mean, i know a fool proof way to get clean pee into a stall and into a cup"
"What are you planning?"
"I don't have the answer to either of those questions but I will next week."
"do you get a stall to pee in?"
"did they watch you pee?"
ask
ok
"not applying yesterday"
"okay this can all be solved pretty easily if you just answer a couple of questions"
"except like"
"there is no way around this"
"Exercise and drink lots of water and test yourself"
"which tells me"
"which may be three weeks to four weeks from now"
Correct.
"yea i mean i may not be able to start later, they would probably want me to start no more than 2 weeks after they hire me, right?"
"Like I said they didn't call me back for a week or two"
"This is all contingent on when they actually cal lyou back"
"Then wait until you know you can pass to put in your two weeks notice. Do everything you can to get it out of your system, and then test YOURSELF before you are ready to go in for orientation and getting an ID or anythhing"
"it picks up on it, and probably will for another month and a half to two months for me"
"it takes a long time for thc to exit your body"
"but ive failed piss tests before"
"It will be urine"
"and hair obviously like 6 months"
"blood, one month"
"It can be detected in urine two weeks out"
"Just make sure you drink plenty of water, which I know you do any way, and do any kind of exercise you can. Get rid of anything that's been metabolized and stored."
"which is accurate two weeks out"
"They're going to do a urine test"
"I have something to say about this"
"i dont know ive been smoking for awhile, a month is probably not enough time to be clean, and i dont want to chance it and make your mom look bad"
"so they didnt call for two weeks, and then i can give a two weeks notice and get another two weeks?"
lol
"They didn't call me back for two weeks and they know me"
"you realize that right?"
"This might not be for another two weeks or so"
"but its nerve wracking"
"and i know how to"
"i know even though i quit smoking im going to have to cheat on the piss test"
"It will be a good job. 1) I will be working there.
2) You will be working with my mom
3) It is a very interesting place to work
4) you will be good at it"
"new job situations make me nervous"
"help reassure me that highland will be a good job"

YES
OMG
"just read it lol"
"what is that"
omg
"Yes. You've taken psychology, you understand what not to do. Fuck, you have a better understanding of mental illness than most people. What people often do is go in there and treat the kids like deliquents. EVen the adults sometimes...WHEN THEY RE NOT"
http://www.news10.com/link/692405/home-health-girl-mauled-by-raccoon-leaves-hospital-with-ear-on-arm
hahaha
"im gonna be good at this job"
so
wow
WHAT
like
"my mom said one time a bht like started fucking disciplining a child based on her own personal values TOTALLY IGNORING the fact that the kid was mentally ill and NOT gonna respond to reason"
"i would take the job very seriously"
"oh yea completely"
"Even though the tasks can be mundane, it's not a joke"
"is that working in that position is being part of a treatment team for someone who is sick. People don't take that idea seriously enough."
"That a lot of people forget"
"the thing that you hve to remember though"
"most often yes. I'll take whatever extra shifts I can grab though"
"im assuming youre only working days?"
"itll be fun to work with chad"
"I assume so"
"im maybe the most motivated person in this building"
"very true"
yea
"which means that there's a lot of immaturity"
"it's the first place people want to work"
"that's why everyone drives you insane"
"""the place you work in between childhood and adulthood"""
"at highland, i wont even need any help with shit"
"here is my definition of ticketmaster"
ticketmaster
"because no one cares"
"and no one can really help you"
"everyone here is such a child"
gah
"i just"
haha
"hopefully not"
hahahaha
"im not working here for much longer"
"that this desk and fuck it"
"this is so exciting"
yayyy
"sounds good"
"ill just research home remedies to be safe as well"
hahaha
"yes because they aren't taking your hair"
"and if theres any thc left, it most likely wouldnt register"
"and then on the day of, i can just hydrate super well"
"with b12 and stuff"
"then start burning fat"
"ill just smoke all i can now"
"in that case, i can purge probably super well"
yeah
"like nothing wil lstart yet"
"say you work a lot at your current job and stuff"
"oh okay"
Right
"obviously that's true"
"okay so they wont test me until i actually go in to start the job?"
"I mean"
"Say you can't do orientation until your two weeks are up"
"Give your two weeks notice when they get back to you, and then stop everything. That is plenty time."
"They won't do it the day of the interview"
"so listen"
Ok
"because carrying pee in your pants is gross"
"but i have to know exactly what day it is"
"i can cheat SUPER easily"
"theres no way i can pass that any time soon"
"but fuck theyre gonna drug test me as soon as the interview me"
"do you think i could tell them like, if they offer me the job very soon, that i would love to have it but my boss wants me to give, like 3 weeks notice?  just to have time to burn everything off"
"i dont want to"
"i know"
"well then smoke it all. whatever you think is appropriate. but don't cheat the drug test in any way. I feel like karma will some how get you for that"
"the better"
"it stores in your fat and the longer your fat has to burn off"
"no it doesnt, the more time you give yourself from the last time you smoked, the btter off you are"
haha
but
"it's not only a waste of perfectly good weed"
"READ IT"
hahahaa
"You know that sounds like a bad idea"
"i feel like i shoudl smoke it all really fast"
"just wait to smoke it"
"i just spent so much money on weed"
don't
"because its pretty easy to cheat on a planned one"
"I mean it's a hospital, they probably do it in hosue lol"
"I'm not sure, why?"
"do they make you go to that one plkace to take it, in dunbar?"
Yes
"the drug test"
question
"because he works there now"
"i hope i can get more info from chad too"
hahaha
YES
"i can deal"
haha
"so typical males"
"oh okay"
"just smug and careless. Not like they're gonna be mean or anything"
"what do you mean by shitty?"
hahaha
"god I wish john still wroekd there"
"but basically no"
"some of the male docs are pretty shitty I've heard"
"so, like TM but without dickhead bosses with little man sundrome"
"so it's #fun and quirky#"
"everyone is crazy"
"and the plus side"
"i will work any day as long as its a night"
"it's so calming"
"i really really like working at night"
lol
"i will work as many weekend shifts as i can"
"I'm technically part time but I'm going ot pick up extra shifts"
"maybe it's contingent on if you're full or part time"
"I can't remember"
"Yeah ok cool. They make you work a shift or like maybe three shifts every other weekend if I understand anyway."
"that would put me at about what i make now"
"the best would be if i could work like, 4 ten hour nights and then extra hours when i can"
"hahaha ""things"""
"Mostly everyone is asleep. Things can happen I guess."
"so you just walk around?"
"everyone is asleep?"
"and im guessing that at night"
Exactly
Yes.
"so you make the most money on night weekends, and then second most on weekday nights?"
"oh i like that lol"
"behavioral health tech"
"which means?"
BHT
"the position?"
"and what is it called again?"
Yes.
"because isnt that what he does?"
"im gonna message chad and talk to him about it"
"youre really the best"
"thank you so much"
"Yeah. Sure. I'll talk to my mom about it later and get her input."
"i hate this"
"i dont want to be the face of ticketmaster"
"and not get yelled at for things"
"i want to be able to walk around"
"if i get the job, im going to be seriously eternally grateful"
"thank you so much"
"I'm on good terms with the guy who hires people too. He likes me. So that's a plus. I can mention you"
"Sounds good haha yeah"
"dont want to on a work pc"
"i will apply when i go home"
"thats amazing"
"They are all nice"
"No. My mom may be your boss sometimes. My mom has friends who work on other units too. It just depends if your working on adult, teen, children's,  tween, rehab ect"
"are the people who are in charge of the whatever you called it that i will be, mean?"
"More or less yea"
"so essentially, it's a job where im responsible for the safety of others but i myself will not really be micromanaged and i can work pretty much any hours"
"Good. Theb it won't be a problem. The idea is more of a certification type deal."
"i know how to do both of those things im pretty sure, positive on the BP part"
"Yes. You need to learn to check BP and do cpr but it's a class taught at work essentially haha"
"paid anat/phys"
"so like"
"oh cool"
"Well they offer classes at certain times on that stuff which for oriebtation you are required to do and they pay you for every hour you're there"
"to be ""something"" officially"
"oh okay so they train you on the job"
"Well no. You have to take cpr and stuff but they pay you for it. Your a certified nursing assistant technically."
"if i make sure to put in my 2 weeks and everything"
"someone here will"
"he would give me a good recomendation"
"is there any opportunity for advancement in that position?"
"Apply on highlands website and I'll let someone know you're doing it. Do you think that your boss would give you a good recommendation?  Or is he gonna be sour?"
"i cannot thank you enough for letting me know about this"
"like seriously"
"thats amazing"
"Yeah. Night shift. They probably need more people on that anyway"
"so is there a shift where i could pretty much just work nights?"
"Like at least see of they call back"
"Online. And I would just stop smoking Now."
"or something?"
"also, can i schedule the drug test for when i know im clean?"
"how do i apply?"
"Which you have haha"
"I know. You would be on your feet and not wanting to kill yourself constantly. They would appreciate someone who isn't a total moron working there. They need more people with common sense and decency"
"no one appreciates me"
"because im tired of ccrying every day"
"ill put in my two weeks as soon as i know for sure i could work there"
"if your mom can get me in there"
so
"okay good"
"Just names of people that could vouch for you. ""She's a good person she'd he a good employee"""
"and what kind of references?"
"None of that's an issue"
OH
"Also you'd need two references."
"uniform, tattoos and stuff, cell phone policy?"
"You basically supervise patients on different wards and take them from place to place. You report to the floor nurse or doctor. It's VERY interesting according to my mom hahaha. And what do you mean restrictions?"
"how is working there, what would i do, what are restrictions?"
"because i am sick of this job"
"please please do"
"I'll find out details for you"
"I don't remember the exact amount"
"Overnight pays more"
"ND you can sign up for as many extra shifts as you want, that's another bonus. Most of the bhts are bone heads and literally not qualified to work digging graves. They would worship you haha."
"chris works 11-7 here so i would need to work overnight i guess"
"okay well i could stop smoking, i just wont buy anymore weed"
"They always need people who aren't idiots. The pay is like 8.47 an hour, 9 on the weekends and like 9.50 over night on the weekends. You could work full time. But do keep in mind they do an initial drug test. My mom likes you and that goes a long way over there."
"how often do they need people?"
"whats the pay and is it full time?"
"If you're willing to quit smoking you can work as a BHT like me. I'm certain. It depends if there's a pay increase in my opinion"
"could i work at highland doing something?"
hahahahaha
now
"josh's facebook"
"but the assclown was blocking up traffic"
"i dont know why"
"by like 4 cops"
"pulled over on the dunbar bridge"
"i saw sam shelton"
"oh btw"
describe
"thats the only way i can decribe it"
"I know right"
YES
"it makes my soul feel good"
just
"so good"
"im listening to within and without"
"I love washed out"
"so now i feel better"
"im listening to washed out"
"i mean"
"So it panned out....okay??"
"I getcha"
"O course"
"or i was going to crash my car"
"I know"
"i had to speak my mind"
"Just focus on what you want your relationship to be"
"I don't think you should make comparisons"
"The dynamic is clearly different for them"
"that kristen demands much less of vince because she doesnt have my ambition"
"but also"
"vince is not happy kristen doesnt work"
"he says that"
"no he says he feels like a failure"
"He said he's satisfied? Is that what you mean?"
"but thats the same as happy pretty muchj"
"well he said ""satisfied"""
"chris said this"
"That makes a lot of sense to me"
Yes
"it will keep me from ever being happy"
"i dont know what to do about my ambition"
because
"washed out calms me down"
haa
please.
.
"and discuss it"
"and accept his explanation"
"Just ask him what took so long"
"Don't yell."
"well good."
ok
"You don't know until you try."
"Here he comes"
"I'm not going to knock on the door because mom will answer"
"that's kind of what's happening"
"Don't punish yourself because you're angery"
"I hate my mom"
"I'm so fucking angry"
"My battery will die soon"
"Wasting my time"
"He's being a dickface"
"I might honk again"
"There's just not much you can do about it now, except literally go in and get him. Say it's getting late"
"I know."
"I AM SO FUCKING ANGRY THIS IS MY EVENING THAT HAS BEEN TOTALLY WASTED"
"IGNORE ME"
"I am getting my ""be a good friend"" advice intertwined with my real advice"
WAIT
"Do you think being the one sitting in the car gives you the upper hand?"
"In terms of dealing with this situation"
BUT
"I know you were just in going to the car to chill out"
Question.
"I'm getting so mad"
"Now I've been sitting in the car for an hour waiting on him"
"Maybe he's interested then"
"He stood up to her when she wanted weed from him"
"That's just how most guys brains work."
AGH
"that doesn't fit."
no
no
"Oh no"
"it's your mom, and he feels like he needs to respect what she wants basically"
"like I said."
"Chris is not going to get up and leave your mom"
"I am upset"
"just wait"
"but you're getting worked up"
"I know"
"Wait dude"
"I'm not his fucking chauffeur"
"Chris had it coming. When your ride leaves, so do you"
"A little passive aggressive, but she had it coming haha"
"well good then"
"I honked the horn"
"and I don't even know if I can grasp all of this without hearing both of you give your side of it"
"I consider myself I pretty good problem solver"
"I'm just letting you know"
"There are some deep issues here"
Dude
"He did when she wanted some weed from him, but he won't stand up for ME"
"That is your call i think"
"no matter how insane"
"She's your mom"
"He's not gonna stand up to her."
"Go inside and get him."
"You aren't doing anything wrong. You're just looking at someone who you perceive to be ""better off"" than you emotionally and wondering why you aren't where they are."
"He won't come outside and I want to go home"
"What am I doing wrong that a married couple of basically the same age is doing a million times better than us, and the chick doesn't even have a job"
*treating
"I don't remember Chris treated me like I was that special since we were dating. He just acts like I'm the best thing in the world when he gets in trouble."
M
"EVERY relationship has then"
"The truth of it is"
"You either get through it or you don't"
"You're in a rough spot in your relationship"
"And she still gets more attention than I do"
"And they're married"
"It made me realize how little attention I'm getting"
"She saw something she wanted at their mall, and he went back and bought it, and told the sales clerk not to say anything, and she went back and was upset that someone bought it, and then he gifted it to her"
"But the reality is you aren't like them."
"Thay must bother you"
"I know"
"You can change in whatever you want you just have to have intention, and the capacity to do it effectively"
"A workhorse"
"And I'm like"
"He is such a gentleman"
Her
"Except for, Vince is a marine so that Kristen can stay home and be an artist and raise geckos and he does so much for he"
"But the thing is"
"I can see how that would he upsetting"
"Because they are a mirror image of our relationship"
"I was kind of upset"
And
"It's about you guys"
"For the reptile show my friend Kristen and her husband Vince came up, and they went to dinner with us and stuff"
"Then talk about it don't scapegoat your nutcase mother"
"He doesn't ever stand up for himself"
"I just really am tired of getting him out of situations"
Haha
"It's BAD to do that"
"You're testing him"
"I do things like this all the time"
"You know?"
Ojay
Like
"But I feel like Chris is a pussy if he can't leave"
Haha
"Don't leave him to the wolves"
"Not unless you don't plan on going back in. In which case it's selfish because you're with chris. If you were alone, not so much. Just cool off and go on back"
"Does it make me a bad child for leaving her inside with Chris?"
"I'm sorry"
"I totally get that. Sounds like bellas mom. Actually I was in an IDENTICAL situation"
"She won't the stupid divorce thing so after blabbing about it for half an hour she makes me listen to her (barely) read her entire court letter bullshit that's written in legal jibberish"
"Yea I almost lost my shit"
"Oh wow"
"She was bitching about me avoiding her and I was telling her I isolate myself because people stress me out and she kept bitching so now I'm sitting in the car"
OK
HAHAAHA
OH
"She wants more weed"
"She smoked like once in 25 years"
"has she always smoked? or is it just a more recent thing?"
HAHAHAHAHA
"She's talking about how she doesn't know how to watch tv when she's high because she can't understand when to laugh"
"what'd she say"
hahaha
"oh no"
Lololol
"My mom talking about smoking weed"

"I HAVE SALSA OK"
OMG
"FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE"
"I HATE WHAT HAS JUST HAPPENED"
"Okay haha. My quick fix was to say ""that is a good picture"" therefore validating that it was a friendly gesture because I am a friend"
"Just flattering"
"Hahaha I don't know it doesn't matter"
"I have a quick fix"
"What do you want it to be?"
"Maybe he's just trying to be friendly?"
"""if you don't mind me saying, that's a pretty cute picture of you.  something about your expression.  cracks me up."""
"What?  What happen?"

*conversations*
"Yeah I know. I've heard you say that before. *memory*"
"Chameleons can be pretty advanced when it comes to care though, so just tell her to do her research"
lolol
"I'm not afraid of holding snakes, it's just, I'm afraid that if one bit me, I would not react appropriately if that makes sense"
"Id say so."
"Is that fear?"
"My mom wants to get a chameleon next month. I told her that if a snake bit me I would panic and beat it to death."
"Hahaha yes!!!"
hahahaha
"She had nothing but good things to say. Matt had nothing to say to me except ""leachies"""
"That's awesome!"
"Awwwww :D"
"(the snake thing)"
haha
"So apparently you're very good at this"
"She would never say that."
"My mom just talked about reptiles at me like 20 minutes and then talked about how you were very professional, charismatic, knowledgeable without being arrogant, and helpful. She then proceeded to tell me how she would be fine with having a snake."
"Is that ""bad"""
"Wow what a general question"
"Is that bad"
"I don't know the show too well"

You feel enraged when things do not go your way. You are sensitive about being treated fairly and feel resentful and bitter if you think you are being cheated. You tend to lack energy and have difficult initiating activities. You do not feel nervous in social situations, and have a good impression of what others think of you. You feel strong cravings and urges that you have difficulty resisting. You tend to prefer short-term pleasures and rewards over long-term consequences. You experience panic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or stress."

"an Jessee
March 25 near Charleston, WV
"" People seem willing to look all over the place for this treasure. They will spend hours launching prayers into the heavens. They will travel halfway around the world to visit a monastery in India or to take part in a mission trip to Belize. The last place most people look is right under their feet, in the everyday activities, accidents, and encounters of their lives. What possible spiritual significance could a trip to the grocery store have? How could something as common as a toothache be a door to greater life?
No one longs for what he or she already has, and yet the accumulated insight of those wise about the spiritual life suggests that the reason so many of us cannot see the red X that marks the spot is because we are standing on it. The treasure we seek requires no lengthy expedition, no expensive equipment, no superior aptitude or special company. All we lack is the willingness to imagine that we already have everything we need. The only thing missing is our consent to be where we are."" â reading An Altar in the World: A Geography of Faith."

Sitting on the back patio enjoying the fruits of my labor today and drinking the wine that only my eyes can drink. What a beautiful evening!"
"Ian Jessee
April 13 near Charleston, WV
Seeing is of course very much a matter of verbalization. Unless I call my attention to what passes before my eyes, I simply won't be able to see it. It is, as Ruskin says, ""not merely unnoticed, but in the full, clear sense of the word unseen."" My eyes alone can't solve analogy tests using figures, the ones which show, with increasing elaborations, a big square, then a small square in a big square, then a big triangle, and expect me to find a small triangle in a big triangle. I have to say the words, describe what I'm seeing.
If Tinker Mountain erupted, I'd be likely to notice. But if I want to notice the lesser cataclysm of valley life, I have to maintain in my head a running description of the present. It's not that I'm observant; it's just that I talk too much. Otherwise, especially in a strange place, I'll never know what's happening. Like a blind man at the ball game, I need a radio. 
When I see this way I analyze and pry. I hurl over logs and roll away stones; I study the bank a square foot at a time, probing and tilting my head. Some days when mist covers the mountains, when the muskrats won't show and the microscope's mirror shatters, I want to climb up the blank blue dome as a man would storm the inside of a circus tent, widely, dangling, and with a steel knife claw a rent in the top, peep, and, if I must, fall.
But there is another kind of seeing that involves a letting go. When I see this way I sway transfixed and emptied. the difference between the two ways of seeing is the difference between walking with and without a camera. When I walk with a camera I walk from shot to shot, reading the light on a calibrated meter. When I walk without a camera, my own shutter opens, and the moment's light prints on my own silver gut. When I see this second way I am above all an unscrupulous observer. â reading Pilgrim at Tinker Creek."

maybe
"im not sure"
"calm music helps i think"
Ok
"let me read through these"
http://bpd.about.com/od/livingwithbpd/tp/angerlist.htm
"This is the best I can do for now"
"would be so satisfying"
"like...a mason jar"
"just something i can damage, preferably something heavy that i can throw at a brick wall or something"
"does it have to be something substantial? or just something you can damage"
"See that's no good"
"or at least hit something really hard and damage myself"
"to feel better"
"i have to do damage"
"i mean"
"not joking"
seriously
"no, if it bounces i get angrier"
"what if you got like a tennis ball or something you could throw on the ground as hard as you can. Maybe a deflated one, so it wouldn't bounce if that's an issue"
"person, furniture, wall, anything"
"beat something mercilessly"
"i need to smash things"
like
yes
"smashing something"
"That relieved your stress?"
"was throwing my phone"
"well what did it for me last time"
"(which I believe would probably be satisfying haha)"
"but there are ways to achieve that same kind of feeling that are not punching someone"
haha
"probably won't come up with it today"
"well I'll help you think of one"
"i know, but i cant think of one"
"There's got to be another way to relieve that though."
"I know."
"as hard as i can"
"it sucker punching someone"
"seriously the only thing i could think that would make me feel better when im upset"
"i just get so violent"
"it's not like I have room to judge haha"
"it's better than thinking about it all day"
"just tell me"
"like if you want to fucking shoot someone"
really
"I think expressing how upset your are is a good thing though"
"i know"
"over nothing"
"i just wish i could stop getting upset"
"That's not what I'm saying."
"Getting upset is a natural reaction though, of course"
"But try your best not to get very upset about things going wrong, because things WILL go wrong. The only way to deal with it is to come up with a solution."
"I agree that it is yours, and you should have control over it."
"That's a good idea. Sound advice."
"she cant take it from me"
"like she does"
"so if she has an episode"
"ariel told me i should get the business rights to the show without her knowing"
"Until then, you have to rely on people you that may not be ideal"
"Eventually you will have control over all of it."
"She's just not."
"Make sure you let her know, next time she does that. I see it this way...She's not going to be a part of this machine forever."
"and leaves out important info"
"she makes us look dumb"
"its about the message"
"shes a fucking tiny lesbian bulldyke, she cant make a phone call though because of her ""crippling anxiety"""
"Is this about properly describing what's going on and getting your message out there? Or is it about validation?"
Well
"That would frustrate me too, I mean. She does sound kind of vapid"
"Okay, I see."
"AND JUST TALKS ABOUT ""ALL HER EXOTICS"", WHICH IS A TOTAL OF LIKE 10 ANIMALS"
"SHE FORGETS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION"
"SHE HAS NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT SHES TALKING ABOUT"
"and i dont get published"
"and get her story"
"they always fucking call her"
"its the news stations too"
"They may even know that. But her family is her family."
"Obviously you're the one doing this. She's just a kid who gets validation from her family."
"That's a normal feeling to have I get that way all of the time. but in reality, they don't matter. Their opinions don't matter. That dynamic is all about jamee, it isn't about what she's accomplished, it's about being proud of her for something. Do you think it would really be validating to take away her family's praise? I'm thinking it would be for a moment, and then the problem would still be there."
"absolutely not her"
"and i want to be like, you fucking idiots,s he's in high school and doesnt breed SHIT, who do you think makes this stuff come together?"
"jamee's friends and family act like its all her"
"Well you're entitled to that then! haha. HOWEVER, you know that people take credit that isn't theirs in the real world, all of the time. Take solace in the fact that you accomplished something and feel personally rewarded, rather than validated by the praise of others. (Speaking of that, people do recognize that this is your brainchild. It's not like you're out of this)"
"she should never get my credit"
"because she does so little"
"and i want to shoot her"
"and people get it wrong and think she owns it"
"yea but i pour my life into this show and jamee does whatever she wants and we split the profit and fame 50/50"
"Think about it. It's much more ideal to complain about a shitty support system than to wish that you at least had one."
"That would not be optimal. Focusing on this 24/7 may be, but you always need a support system. No matter the quality."
"that would be optimal"
"if i could quit my job and focus on this 24/7 and fire everyone else"
"Ok, well what could they be doing to help?"
"because jamee is constantly fucking up, i dont even have to tell you about chris, and take a good look at chad and assess that for yourself"
"That's a very broad statement to make."
"How do you know that this is true?"
"Ok ok ok"
"in this scenario"
"because everyone that isnt me is dumb"
"i have to do everything or people will fuck it up"
"yes but this show is going to be so stressful"
"I think the big picture is more important. Wouldn't you agree?"
"The ""big picture"" is you're getting a new car soon. The ""little picture"" is that it's not soon enough."
"is the result of focusing on ""little picture"" things"
well
"Something that you tend to get upset about"
"and now im upset"
"just talking about the car"
"it just happened"
"i dont know"
"why aren't you happy?"
"no but since im not happy right now it seems stressful and not fun"
"And you love it (duh)"
Yep
"im not going to get any rest for the next two days"
exactly
"theres so much happening"
"i cant im so stressed"
"Try and focus on something else"
ok
Ok
"some guy just saw that I had notes about suicide open and I was laughing and he looked at me funny"

"I want to die"
"I can say something to amuse you, if you'd like"
"It's not about exercising, it's about clearing your head. Being mindful. Just enjoying fresh air because we get so little of it. If you over think it, then it doesn't work"

"Like he wants me there"
"Now he's sending me photos of his trip to the store"
"He tries I think"
"Listen to me about josh....He's an adult baby, and he's your friend when  he feels like it. He doesn't want a real relationship with anyone"
"I don't think that that would work out well"

"Josh hates me probably"
"I want to drive into the river but I'm too spineless"
"The world is sucky"
"I'm thinking more specific than that"
"The world"
"is something specific bothering you at the moment?"
"and I can't change it"
"You feel that way"
"I don't know what to tell you"
"In this world"
"I am alone"
"I want to die"
"I'm just parked and crying"
"Are you okay?"
"What exactly is on your mind"
"what does travis have to do with this?"
"and I think chris does hunter"
Anyone
"Maybe he just doesn't want to deal with this"
"Or Travis"
"And Chris doesn't either"
"Because josh doesn't even care about me at all"
"I am sitting in my car crying"
"Going to work naked."
"but maybe that's just where you are right now."
"Like I know that doing chores is the cohabitational equivlent of working clothes to work"
"I think maybe you can't expect more in one day than he can do"
"the more you disapprove or approve openly the more likely it is that something will change. Being quiet about things was the issue."
"it also would take time to change"
"because in this situation"
"because you regret disappointing him"
"you'd be feeling guilty"
"but you wouldn't be expecting him to be okay with that"
"because it takes time to change"
"and then expecting him to be okay with that"
"i do drugs"
"and then the next day"
"chris saying, dont do drugs"
"thats like"
"Changing someone's behavior is a process"
"I think you need to give him a chance to complete the chores he can complete today"
"You can't change someone over night"
"but how many times must i politely ask him to grow up?"
"because i didnt want to be like that"
"i didnt dive into him yesterday"
"just take a deep breath"
"like that came before him not doing them"
"you kind of dove right in to being upset"
"rather than checking in with him about the chores"
"but it's easy to see when someone else is doing it and hurting themselves"
"me neither and it's ruined a lot of things in my life"
"expecting less is not what i do"
"expect less"
"for now let's not dwell on that"
"he didnt set an alarm"
no
"but he can do the otehrs"
"So he can't do the one chore."
"He mistakenly slept in."
"that's better than what he did yesterday."
"He followed through"
"That's something."
"If he does everything but that"
"let's start with this"
"because he slept past the bus time"
"well he cant do all f it"
"(yes, I'm going back to that)"
"Is he doing them?"
"like this whole list of things"
?
"that maybe chris is doing this things you asked"
"have you thought"
question
"*i need help"
"josh said, message me later, because help and not company"
"talked to both parties"
"have you talked to chris anymore?"
"you're under a lot of stress"
but
"and rightly so"
"I don't think you realized it because you're upset"
"you did kind of guilt josh there"

"but i dont even like talking about the ""what ifs"""

"he could claim half the animals are his, he could tell everyone we know that i do drugs, and lie to people about my business practices"
"How could he? And I wish you had more of am easy choice to make here"
"plus, he could destroy my business if he wanted to"
"i feel like if i left him, no matter the situation, it woul dbe a grave mistake"

Not like ""Is this because you're lazy? we're different? you don't care about it?"""
hahaha
Kinda
hahaha
"more like"
Well
"oh so, like, just fucking do it."
"It's super straightforward kind of conflict resolution"
"It's more or less ""do this"" 
""why haven't you been doing it""
""you don't have to apologize, just tell me you'll do it"""
haha
"in some cases, psychoanalyzing everyone's reasoning makes it harder"
"whether he's doing it or not"
"but what is also true, is it doesn't matter the why, the what matters"
"That's true."
"i dont know whichj"
"he is just lazy"
OR
"it doesnt bother him when things arent taken care of"
"he just does not care"
"its like"
"well i mean"
hahaha
lol
"lacks the attention span to follow through on anything unless you put it in her face"
"my sister falls in to group two"
true
yes
"because that can be changed"
haha
"That's actually better than the second one"
guilt
"i had to help him with it, and afterwards, he just thanked me"
"or 2) he is one of those people who's more responsive when you're in their face saying DO THIS. Some people are responsive to that beest"
"1) he is acting based on guilt"
"One of two things is happening"
"But just now I asked, and he did it without hesitation"
"i asked him to take pictures of a gecko's belly because he may be egg bound, to send to ron tremper, who FOUND the TREMPER albino strain in leopard geckos, and I needed his help, and he didn't do it"
"*he should have just done that shit*"
"*friend interjection*"
"he still MAY not"
"you can't just assume he knows based on perceived actions"
"youre right"
"it needs to be daid"
yea
"but still, just for clearity"
"I know."
"because he may have realized"
"but i almost dont want to have it"
"It is."
"i feel like the talk is required"
"i dont know"
maybe
"Will that at least inspire him to listen next time? I mean, that obviously wasn't pleasant"
"That makes sense."
"and started crying"
"i was flabbergasted"
"and i didnt start cussing and yelling"
"he had done nothing"
"when he told me"
"i think he realized he fucked up"
*enjoy*
"In reality, it might just be him being nice because he never realized he had done something to bother you"
"or maybe just a gesture"
"could be either"
true
"but, could it be him trying to compensate, out of guilt?"
"well it could be that. that's your first thought"
Ok
"""this makes hunter stop being a bitch"""
like
"he was like, here, and handed me the bowl"
"but yes, you have to have it"
"That's not okay. hahahaaha"
later
"ill have to have this conversation"
"he foiled me"
"dammit to hell"
"he gave me marijuana and made me stop caring"
"That's very clear."
lol
"i put thought into that"
"""chris, i feel hurt and disrespected because you ignored the note i left for you, when you had all day off of work, and you promised you would do these things.  i even made the gecko food before i left work so you would have to. i spend every day I have off cleaning or running errands, and I feel like you are not pulling the amount of weight that I am"""
"I mean obviously, this isn't a one time occurrence. So a real conversation needs to be had."
"Well, you need to prepare yourself FOR that. And prepare yourself for the conversation, like what is the best way to address it. Let's say, you were feeling angry...a rush of anger may cause you to say something that doesn't help what you're trying to address. So maybe try and figure out what you want to say to him beforehand so it doesn't happen on impulse."
"not emotional"
emotion
"i think right now im kind of over it, but i still need to discuss it with him, and when that happens, the initial emotional will return"
"Rather than saying ""I'm blank"" or ""I feel nothing"" try and see if there's something you can call it."
"60% of dealing with BPD, is actually finding ways to COPE with emotion. You're going from happy to sad at the same rate throughout the day as anyone else, it's just dealing with those transitions that's difficult, which might make it seem more extreme. I know you're feeling blank at the moment, but trying to figure out what to call your emotion in response to chris might help you find ways to deal with what happened."
okay
"Here's something that I want you to understand. It's not me criticizing you or analyzing."
"we have always the same foods. usually this makes me angry.  right now, it is inconvenient, but im not angry, and i dont want it"
"I see."
"i cant decide what to eat"
"im just sitting here"
"i dont know what to do with myself"
"i have no hunger"
"that i feel no motivation to discuss it"
"i feel so blank"
"Maybe tell him how you feel about that. Just let him know that it isn't about the chore"
"and after he realized this, he tried to make up for it with something ""later."" But that undermines you and kind of defeats the point of a note, or entrusting him to do things at all."
"It's that you specifically asked for him to do his part, and he ignored it"
"It's not the idea of him completing a chore."
"I understand that."
"the issue is, the disrespect"
"thats not the issue at all"
but
"and then he came home and fed the geckos"
"he just said, im still going to do it"
"What was his reaction when you confronted him about it?"
"that ""blankness"" might be appropriate"
"based on what I know your expectations to be"
"There's so many things you could feel in response to that"
"That is an appropriate response. I'd say you were angry, upset, slightly ""unheard,"" and maybe a little disrespected. How is anyone supposed to respond to such an array of emotions? (Whatever yours may be in this situation, I'm just guessing)"
since
blank
"and then ive just been"
"i just started crying and saying, you must be joking"
"well i cant really think at all"
"Have you discussed this with him?"
"you're thinking ""globally"" rather than ""internally."""
"It's you and chris who have different ""degrees of importance"" placed on different things."
"It's not you and ""the rest of the world"""
"It's more or less what people find most important in their lives."
"Saying other's care less is ascribing value to feelings, saying one is better than the other"
"It's not that."
"and thats not their fault"
"like i do"
"i think i need to understand that other people do not care"
"You don't know what emotion is appropriate. This has happened so many times in one way or another that you didnt know what emotion fit the situation. Are you angry? upset? I think you may be feeling confused, because based on the note this morning, there was a notion that he would follow through. However, it's maybe taken you off guard and you're just kind of, ""blank."""
"because i cant be"
"im not even mad"
"and i did not know what to feel"
"that i asked"
"he had not done anything"
"and when i got home"
"so i left him a short and simple, very easy to-do list and a cute note too"
"chris left me a cute note this morning"
"and i think that i should assess it instead of feel it"
"i got so upset, that i stopped feeling any emotion because i dont know how to feel"
"what situations"
well
ok
"the situations around me"
"with handling"
"within myself"
"i ma having troubles"
*snaps*
Hahahaha
"gotta go home"
"now we drake"

"She's good with social sciences. She really likes her psychology course. She's good at biology, memorizing things. She wanted to study marine biology but I think she was pressured into thinking she wasn't smart enough. I could only do so much to help there."
"what is she good at?"
"she's afraid not to"
"she plays into what her mom studied"
"because of her dysfunction with her mom"
"she's still all hippy and what not, but she knows she too smart for fashion"
"She's what her mother wants her to be"
"because i guess i dont know real bella"
"then who is she actually?"
wait
"she's just played into this persona"
s
"she's better at real thing"
no
"is not even good at what she IS?"
"especially in her jewlry making class"
"that this free spirited, smoke weed, skateboard, hippie, tie dye girl"
"on creativity"
"so youre telling me"
Yes
"does she get graded based on that?"
WHAT
lol
"I thin kthat may be why"
so
"her work is not as creative as anyone else's"
"they tell her"
"her professors"
"she's not good enough at it"
well
she's
"wire wrapping, studying rare gems, glass blowing?"
because
"why isnt she studying a skill?"
"then why is her career choice not obvious?"
yes
"does bella actually love her crafting?"
"wait up"
*bella*

"and hes all concerned about the show money not all going to the car"
"i told him we can buy his stuff and then after the show, i can just use some show money to hold us over until next check"
"because ive been stressing about it"
"i thinkhes stressed about the car"
"But, you aren't."
responsible.
"and that's how you feel."
"you can't be responsible for his happiness and yours"
"but you're overwhelmed"
"The goal is for both of you to be happy"
"I mean"
"I get that"
"so i can kind of get a grip"
"i just need him to be happy"
"i dont even think i can handle it on that level right now haha"
"But the fight isn't about money. It's about his reaction to what he perceives as his needs not being met."
"Money is the root of all evil. There will always be fights about it."
"caused by money"
"im so tired of these dumb fights"
"That's okay. He doesn't have to like geckos. But it makes sense that it bothers you that he started the whole thing and is backing away. The point is, YOU'RE really into that."
"even though he started that"
"i mean its not like he shows interest in my geckos anymore"
"I understand. Okay. He says ""no one wants to do anything with him"" because you buy animals but condemn what he likes. That's an automatic thought for sure. but it's very internal, the global issue is he wants his interests recognized as much as yours, but he interpreted it as a kind of ""no one loves me"" type deal"
"because i buy the animals and i bitch when he wants juice"
"thats why he gets mad"
"i hate spending money on juice as well"
"makes me sick"
"but the whole trend of it"
"i like it for me"
"i hate vaping"
but
"i dont know why"
"i get upset when he wants to go buy juice or when he wants to go to the vape shop"
Good
"trying to be productive"
"so im addressing those now"
"i think i know what the actual issues are"
"So don't try and MAKE sense of it. There is none. Just let him say it to you. It proabably makes him feel better just ot be heard."
"that makes sense"
"because it's just ""automatic thinking"""
"none of it applies"
"none of it is relevant"
"He's just jumping from self blame in one area to self blame in another"
Listen
"i dont understand"
"he says the problem is that he doesnt know how to say no or stand up for himself"
"Don't blame yourself."
"You can't cause the depression of otehrs."
"You are not the reason he is depressed. It's obvious from the way he speaks to you."
No.
"im just lazy"
"i feel like i make him feel even worse"
"no it's not."
"that sounds like someone who's incredibly depressed"
"its because of me though"
"It's because he's incredibly depressed"
"now he says""there is no joy in this life"""
"and our hobby has now become work"
"and we just work all day and then watch shitty tv"
"he says that its because we never go outside"
"we didnt used to, ever"
"why do we fight so much now"
"why is the relationship this hard"
"i just dont even know what to say"
"im trying"
"so try and relax"
"it's emotionally fueled"
"and solving problems when you're angry doesn't work"
"It's obvious that you're angry"
"take a deep breathe"
"Try not to"
"that im tearing up"
"im just so angry"
"take it one step at a time."
"Focus on what's going on right now."
"or are you just lashing out?"
"is that relavent to this discussion?"
well
Ok
"he gives up and makes me do the work"
"it's not exactly him."
"he will not put the effort that i put into fixing a problem or an argument"
"you can't."
"You're letting his neurosis get to you."
"or tell him it isn't true."
"ask him what that means?"
"now hes pissed me off royally"
"""theres just nothing else to do"""
"he said"
ok
"and then ill show you the sarcasm drenched answer i recieve"
"let me try that"
"Just tell him that's not true. Say, just because I don't want to go hiking doesn't mean I don't want to do something with you. Let's figure out something we could both agree upon together that we would both enjoy."
"what do i even"
"""I'm just saying if I ever want to go do something for myself, I'll have to do it alone. 2:42 PM 
Which im used to.  2:42 PM

"""
"oh god"
"Forget about the hiking and talk about this with him. Try and resolve his insecurities"
"it's not about the hiking for either of you."
"That's what this is about"
"and that he just wants to get a real career already so he can actually have things"
"he says i spend all our money and hes only working to live"
"i am selfish"
"i feel like a piece of shit"
"at least"
"i hear about it for a week"
"because then if it doesnt happen"
"i dont like planning to go hiking"

"of coutse sunday and today are NOT good days"
"it's about planning to at some point"
"it's not about you no doing it on a certain day"
"Like I said"
"HE KNOWS THAT I GET ILL WHEN I GET TOO HOT"
"IT WAS SO HOT ON SUNDAY"
"He's considered what you want recently. I think you're displacing your anger about something else on to hiking. It can't just be about hiking. That's a very small detail right?"
"Your thoughts on this are valid"
"I don't think you should have to, though"
"but at some point consider it"
"Well I understand why you don't want to"
"im sure hes reading this"
"and hes putting himself in the place to get a lot of hatred right now"
"my mom used to make me go hiking"
"he sits in the house in his pajamas all day"
"might be easy for him to spend a day doing nothing in the woods, when he has THREE DAYS OFF, and i basically get zero days off, because im babysitting him or taking care of other bullshit"
"And don't say he didn't. He grew up about a lot of things. I think you should go hiking with him, at least once."
"he says ""ive been trying to get you to go since the last time we went"""
"he made sacrifices for you recently"
BUT
"of course"
"NOT today"
"i dont want to go on a fucking hike"
"Well think of this"
"ok ok"

"""I am not going to tell you how pretty you are."""
"thats what i took, and also...."
"that's what I took"
"maybe he meants ""you should be hearing it from chris"""
"He gave an answer"
"I think that response is acceptable"
yep
"But remember, you like to connect dots that aren't there. Your theory may be true, but it isn't provable."
"a small bit"
"i found hidden meaning in it"
"is it cruel"
"do you think that repsonse is""okay""?"
but
yes
"which is exactly what you wanted, right?"
"not as a romantic partner"

it hurt my feelings

 Sent at 6:14 PM on Wednesday
 me:  i dont know why i seek praise from people who are reluctant to give it
it's incredibly masochistic
 lordmacbayne:  I am not going to tell you how pretty you are.
That's not something you need to hear from me.
Pro or con"
"Did he tell you?"
"let me show you"
"about josh"
"The difference is bellas mom is smart, organized, and has bella in a Stockholm sort of hold. It's like a psychological leash and because she's still close with her mom I would have to rip it off her neck"
"i was right"
here
"mine is only slightly different"
"that was his ""normal"""
"and hes a better person for it"
"he sees it"
"and he knows now"
"but eventually i did"
"i tried not to explain it too much to him"
"thats how i was about chris' parents being abusive"
"I feel RESPONSIBLE for HER"
"because not only am I in a relationship with her"
"I don't know what would happen"
"that If I started pointing shit out and saying how I felt"
"they're so normal"
now
"things that were unhealthy"
"I never mentioned things that wwere weird"
"I could've done that years ago according to therapists. But now, holding up a mirror to someones fucked up life...it's a detrimental thing to do. They could fall completely apart."
"because your time is very valuable"
"Here's the issue"
"i think that you should be upfront about it with her"
"this is kinda how it would have been if chris had not seen what he sees now, and i had to remove myself from the situation...i feel kind of like his ""Caretaker"", or mom"
"It's a waiting game now that she's away from home."
"It's basically all on her."
"so I can break away from her mom"
"but I need her to realize that her relationship wit hher mom is unhealthy"
"I don't want it to end"
"I have done everything her mom was supposed to do for the past 4 years."
"but resent her as a companion"
"as a parental figure"
"I would have the desire to comfort her"
"wouldn't have seen it coming"
"she would be lost and confuseed"
"if I ended it"
"this is very freudian"
"but think about it"
"they give me these tiny things to say and do to try and bring up my issues with the relationship"
"thats it"
"by getting help"
"is bella"
"the only person who can help you"
really
"AND NO ONE KNOWS HOW TO HELP ME"
"thats pretty much the exact position chris was in, but less extreme"
"ITS TRUE"
"""you are in a three way relationship with you girlfriend and her mother. You have also taken on the role of father because her mother knows you will do everything, and you don't want to break up with someone you take care of. (they didn't want to say daughter)"""
"tell me"
"I've had three therapists THIS YEAR"
"man we are fucked up"
"well, i gravitate towards the ones that DO praise me...they just ""make me work for"" their praise.  and then when i get the approval, it makes me happy, because in some sick way i feel like i worked for it"
"than based on freud, that's also the reason that you gravitate to men who won't praise you but need their praise."
"if that's true"
*frued*
"probably has something to do with having a father that never praised me"
even
what
"that's so inappropriate that he would start joking around like that"
like
"his behavior"
hahaha
"tolerate what?"
"HOW DO YOU TOLERATE THAT"
"I'm switching back to friend mode"
"""me:  i need time to cool down
just so i can gather myself

Ok
Not oj
Like the juice is loose.
If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."""
"look, he's being ""funny"""
GOOD
"and now it seems like hes acting like he knows what he did"
"and i told him i need time to cool down"
"i logged back in, and he had said, what the hell are you going on about?"
"the last think i said was,  fucking hate myself, and i logged off"
"i think josh already understands"
lol
"mine has never done that"
"would not go anywhere"
"like, broke"
"his broke on a weekly basis"
"yours is not that bad"
"I mean if his would barely start"
"that's true"
"so i may actually get a couple grand credit on my car"
"yea theres afew places, i just like this one because they gave travis 900 dollar credit for that car that literally was worthless"
"There is a place in SC that gets people cars with bad credit"
"so i will have small payments"
"so after the reptile show, i cantrade in my car, and put down a load of money"
"the place travis traded in his almost-never-runs sebring and got an awesome jeep gave him 900 credit on that piece of shit car, and travis only had to put down 500 dollars, and he drove off in his jeep, and he has shit credit, they financed for him"
what?
"and i found out something promising"
"thats very true"
"We've actually been very productive in assisting one another today lolol"
haha
lol
"this is why i need you"
see
"thats true"
"This way you can discuss it together"
"The answer might surprise you. Giving someone options is never good. Your original question was emotionally loaded."
"thats like the least annoying/pushy way to approach something"
"thats a good idea"
Exactly!
YES
"give him the chance"
"let him say something about it"
"all you need to say  ""you said this"""
"oh i see"
"not unless you want"
"not necessarily"
"he wants to be able to own up to it the way he wants"
"repeat what he said and then say ""and that made me feel etc etc etc"""
"that will make him mad"
"don't ""weigh out options"""
"and ask him why he said it"
"Just repeat it back"
"that's overanalyzing"
"don't say that"
"Just saying ""you said this"" is better"
"do you actually think im ugly, or were you just saying that so you didnt have to comment on my physical appearance?"
"I honestly think"
"before you do that"
Wait
"i think im going to just ask him"
"It's the fact that he went out of his way to proclaim it. And it was VERY facetious."
"I know."
"its just the way he said it"
"i mean, i really dont care so much about if josh finds me attractive or not"
"Try to not dwell on things like that."
"However, automatic thoughts aren't going to help."
"I agree that you should give it time to cool off."
"when im less likely to cry at my desk"
"ill probably ignore it for now and mention it later"
"In theory, he shouldn't"
"thats very true"
"He shouldn't get offended."
"This isn't about how he feels, it's about how you feel about what he said to you. You're just addressing what is bothering you. As long as you don't accuse him of things. You just need to restate what happened. It's simply owning up to your feelings. This upset you, and he was part of it, and you want clarity and why it happened."
"then what?"
"and he will get angry"
"im worried that i will offend him"
"You know how to talk to people, but you also know how to argue. I think you need to discuss this with him. However, I don't think you need to argue. Resist the urge to fight and don't take his bait if he tries ti initiate it."
"and i dont want that"
"in the event that he is being cruel, do i address that with him?  or just stop talking to him?  at some point, there would probably be a fight, and that equals an enemy"
"i mean"
"Listen, I'm not going to tell you you're wrong, but I'm not going to tell you you're right. I think you should seriously think about it. That's not something a friend says to another friend. Even if he was thinking ""what if chris was watching.."" 

Is there friendship even healthy if he is thinking that?"
"i dont know"
twice
"and remember, he apologized for it"
"no he wasnt being cross, hes depressed and he just wasnt talking to me much"
"He isn't consistent with you."
"But that's on and off."
"All day today."
"That's not what you've told me."
"hes talked to me all day"
"Really, really think about how that makes you feel, and if you want to continuing pursuing it."
"he has actually been pretty nice to me"
"He has been really cross with you lately, and has been toying with your emotions in the friendship."
"Okay that could be a real possibility, and that's IDEAL. But let's really think about it. How many times in life do we all interpret bad things into good things by saying there's a ""time"" or a ""place"" or a reason something happened, when in reality, something just ""happened."""
"that i am attractive, in not so many words"
"because he has told me before"
"maybe he was just trying to avoid complimenting my physical appearance because he knows chris reads everything?"
"you need to break the cycle"
"you need to find a way to put josh behind you. This whole dynamic has been unhealthy for a while and this is just its coming to a head."
"i told him i hate myself and signed off chat"
"I seriously thought for one second he would be a decent friend to you"
"what am i even supposed to say to him asbout it"
"it's not like he's retarded"
"and he's smart enough to know that"
"that was uncalled for"
"Like in my opinion"
"You tend to gravitate towards people who aren't good, and I thought he was different, but he's just as mean as other guys you've been friends with"
"and It's offensive and cruel"
"It's not true"
"No friend would say that."
"That is what's happening here."
"We're back to where you flee to guys who end up being bad without even knowing it."
ok
"WHAT THE FUCK"
"basically telling me, hey you may be ugly, but youre nice enough i guess"
"and he basically said ""youre a perfectly good person, william s burroughs wasnt beautiful, etc etc )"
"and i said, i guess it would be nice to be beautiful, i know im very smart and everything, but when i look in the mirror, its sad"
"and he said, well ive told her several times, so i guess she knows"
"and i was just like, i wonder if people who we rave about know that we love them so much"
"josh was raving about that cindy chick who EVERYONE wants, she used to work here and then relocated to LN in VA"
"why are you depressed?"
"but what's wrong?"
"good point."
"but dont miss out on an opportunity like that"
"because theres always time to make up a class"
"do the research and job thing"
"what's going on"
"oh no"
"im very depressed"
"i forgot, im sorry"
"shore thang"
"give me a minute to read"
"im sorry, so much going on around me"
hahahaha
"also whatever happened to your book about work. I lost the link to that"
"The fact that these are decisions that I'm having trouble with makes me feel like a shitty person"
"1) Job and Class. Saving me from taking a class next summer and being caught up enough to study for my MCAT exam in 2016. However I wouldn't be getting research experience. 
2) Job for a month (I found out I could do this) and then research. I would make about the same amount of money. BUT without the class I will behind on study for my med school entrance exams the next summer. 

Is being ahead of schedule academically more important to me or is getting experience I'll use later more important?"

"what is more important for me to do"
"I DONT KNOW WHAT TO PICK"

"oh, tell me"
"the reptile report is an international news source for reptiles, so i just go on there and constantly submit links and articles to promote our business or show"

he says he's going to get us out of two wars
 me:  i mean, insurance companies are required to contribute to medical expenses now though
 lordmacbayne:  he takes FOREVER to do that
and in the end
doesnt really
insurance companies are pretending to be hurt
but in reality this is what the AFC means for them
either they get a bunch more customers mandated by law
or
things stay exactly the same.
the present system is good for them
so this is a win/win
 me:  i cannot say that i disagree with you, honestly.  i mean, i do on some points. but that all makes sense.

or at least 40
 me:  I don't know how he did that, but I bet you know what you're talking about.
 lordmacbayne:  bush was the best thing that ever happened for freedom in this country
because
he was INSANE.
and everyone fucking knew it.
and after 8 years
and a stolen election
people were like
""shit.  we really have to pay attention to this stuff next time.""

"you avoided my question. If you could use a machine to create the perfect geckos would you?"
"where with leos, they are mature in 8 months, and if i want to, to refine a trait, i can breed back to parents"
"the gene pool is so small that only fucking idiots and greedy pigs breed them back"
"well, i am engineering them, one generation at a time.  and it's especially difficult with crested geckos, because it takes them around 2 years to be sexually mature, if not longer, and you cannot line-breed them because originally only 200 specimens were imported"
"would you ""engineer"" reptiles if you could? to make the perfect specimens? Or is it about the challenge of doing it by ""hand?"""
okay
haha
"this is a loaded question"
question
"to oversee the eugenics"

"and i know he finally understands"
"and i explained to him how his parents abused him"
yup
"Like daily weekly and monthly accomplishments"
"Yeah exactly"
"i explained to him how he needs to build short term goals and long term goals, because the short term goals keep you feeling like you can accomplish things"
"Which he is doing. One step in a process can make the whole thing seem more do able"
"I would not tell him how I feel. That's what I take issue with. Hahaha. But yeah that was the whole point"
"and thats all i want, is for him to be receptive to my feelings"

"I know"
"he is probably severely damaged from his fucking retarded inbred parents"

however

"that has a lot of earning potential"
"see, you didnt QUITE understand the monetary possibilities in this market until now hahaha"
haha
"thats insane"
"I have never be anything to be worth over 1,000 dolalrs"
"but omg"
yes
"its a crash course"
"started to grasp these concepts? haha"
"so theyre highly sought after and babies start at about 2500"
"there are very few of them, and they have purples on them"
"such as Canawaa isle leachies"
"are the RARE collector quality"
"the highest highest tier"
BUT
"they are collector quality"
"now, both of my babies were 700 dollars"
hahah
wow
haha
"and you have leachies"
"but applied to a gecko whose base price is 300 dollars"
"now imagine that concept"
"collector quality is what i strive for"
"some breeders can be also considered low quality"
"that makes mroe sense"
"I see"
OH
"the pet quality are kind of the mutts"
"and then collector/breeder quality"
*quality
"breeder wuality"
"there is pet quality"
"like, lets say leo[pard geckos"
"because there are levels"
"not really"
eh
"so they're like the equivalent of muts"
"just like cresteds"
"and breed"
"theyre easy to find"
"theyre not rare"
"theyr enormally cheap"
"and unless youre paying top dollar for a very cool morph"
"so I get it"
"you followed up"
"leopard geckos are super super basic geckos"
"okay well"
haha
"That simile made no sense to me"
"and they breed very easily"
"theyre fairly cheap"
"cresteds are like the leopard gecko of the rhacodactylus community"
"that they very well could be"
"but I see now"
"""those aren't the most interesting"""
"until theyre adults"
"is that you dont even know what theyre actually going to look like"
"but I was thinking"
"there seem to be a lot of cresteds"
"and the best part"
"I was wondering that"
"its like a gift in an egg"
"every hatchling is a surprise"
"its very very fun, and thats why people love it"
"that makes it a #fun challenge then I suppose in a way"
"but with cresteds, you dont know what you will get"
"yes, like, with my leopards i know X +X=Y"
"but not with crested geckos exactly"
"you know what you're gonna get"
"you know what you're gonna breed"
"with some"
"this is what I'm getting"
"It's not like crested geckos are like a set of variables with set outcomes, there's more ambiguity"
"my mom had brown hair, my dad had black hair, i have dark brown hair"
"kind of like humans"
"crested geckos are all about polygenetics"
"but with crested geckos, thats never happened"
"most reptiles have ""morphs"". a morph is a genetic mutation that started in the wild and somehow someone bred geckos to geckos until an anomaly gecko popped up.  this means that the genetic mutation is solid, and can be proved out.  you breed a blizzard to a blizzard and you get blizzards."
"I am a layman"
"LAYMANS TERMS"
LAYMANS
"in basic terms"
"let me explain"
anyways
hahaha
"but not really"
"kind of similar"

but
"im not a HUGE leopard fan"

basically
"its like a unicorn baically"

"dude just make moonglow jokes"
moonglow
"MOON GLOW"
"people take photos of their colorful geckos fired down to white and joke and are like ""hurr hurr look at my moonglow"""
"that sounds biologically impossible considering"
"it doesnt exist"
"it means that the gecko stays white, even when fired up, which has never happened"
"and people make a huge joke out of it"
"what does that imply?"
"people every once in awhile claim to have a moonglow and what thousands of dollars for it"
MOONGLOW
hahahahaahaha
"moonglows are a joke"

"to hold a red for you"
"i will ask ariel"

ok
"so, good gas mileage"

"its going to be a small car"
"so far for travel, we will need about 200 dollars, you will need about 100"
haha
"you just said that"
"oh wait"
"Okay wait. so what kind of car hypothetically would we be renting? What are we looking at so I can estimate the fuel cost"
"about 55 dollars from you"
lol
"let me get a figure for you"
so
"and the gas is going to (depending on the car) be about 80 there, 80 back"
"yeah certainly"
"sounds very doable, we can just switch halfway through the trip'"
"355.88 mi - about 5 hours 38 minutes to chicago"
"and then"
"161.65 mi - about 2 hours 49 minutes to columbus"
"We've got: 517.53 miles / 8 hours 28 minutes total trip"
"okay awesome"
"It's in columbus"
"I just map quested this to figure it out"
"what town is your college in so i can factor it into picking you up?"
"and for the car you'd end up paying about 60 dollars as 1/3 of the cost"
okay
"hold on. I wanna check something"
sunday
"i want to make sure we're rested when we get there or it's gonna be hell, so we need to leave late friday night, not in the morning on saturday.  and yes the 12th is dunday"

"but different"
"its like ketamine"
"its pretty safe"
"but that's a summation of all of the info I've collected haha"
"I can't tell you what to do"
"so there has been VERY little research done about this drug. I know that is a serotonin agonist and an acetylcholine antagonist, which basically means euphoria/trouble moving/floating feeling. I know that it can cause ACUTE cerebellar ataxia, or loss or coordination, but no one knows how long those effects actually last. the recommended dose is 5-100mg but the safer route if you're going high seems to be 40. There's a higher risk I think of doing more because so little is known about its exact toxicology, but it's quite similar to a derivative of ketamine and PCP.To date, there have been 1 or 2 documented ER cases involving MXE and 4 deaths associated with it."

"my whole life i've been in like 7 or so relationships"
"it's not like I dated a bunch in high school"
"ive just never had to deal with anything that painful"
"i guess you're right"
"start getting used to the fact that she may move down there, and come to terms with that, just in case it does happen"
"it can't be"
"you're right"
"I seriously never considered that all of these timelines and maybes were to lessen the blow hah"
"so you shouldnt stress too much"
"well this is a problem that cannot be remedied AT ALL any time soon"
"i don't want it to come to anything"
"she'll just make the decision herself"
"What I'm hoping is yeah"
"any person with half a brain would make the right call. but there are circumstances"
"thats why im saying she will choose honestly"
exactly
yes
"I'm saying choose"
"it's not like I'm insisting she come with me"
OH
"because youre giving her both choices"
"thats when people choose what they actually want"
"no, when you break it down to one thing or another"
idk
"like should would always resent me?"
"would you be able to live with the guilt of saying ""me or your mom"" or should that not COME with guilt. The fear is ""would that create a ""guilt driven--spitfeul"" relationship"
go
question
"This isn't happenign till mid summer if it's happening"
"yeah. It's been like two days"
"and she'll realize its not realistic"
"maybe in time itll sink in"
lol
"shes obviously not thinking it through"
"i need to get off that"
"like how does she think that will work"
"like florida to ohio to wv to florida"
"yes thats reasonable"
"I mean I'm not saying she can't visit her mother. (as much as I would enjoy that) but saying she lives there is insanity"
right
"not her mom"
"to stay with you"
"and when her school lets out or whatever"
"well, then tell her to stay at her school"
like
"in our position"
"or anyones"
"she could but she has a really good friend in kent, who I really like. She likes it there. I can deal with THIS distance. Just not the florida distance. That distance is not realistic for our relationship"
"she could transfer to your school"
"an expensive waste"
"I wouldn't wanna tear her away from school. But like, over break and stuff, she could stay with me instead of going to florida. going back and forth between florida four to five times a year seems like a RIDICULOUS notion"
"deal breaker"
"that woul dbe it for me"
"okay if she could live with you and go to college with you, and she chooses not to"
haha
"dude I have a job. I have a place to live. If she so desired, she could literally live with me"
right
"and she plans to buy 500 bucks in tickets to go back and forth"
"that sounds like lightening the news"
"""[3/22/14, 7:07:38 PM] Izzabella Och: If my moves to florida, I will not be there ALL summer
[3/22/14, 7:07:53 PM] Izzabella Och: I will probably go when you are doing internships and whatnot
[3/22/14, 7:08:06 PM] Izzabella Och: This is just something thats being discussed
[3/22/14, 7:08:14 PM] Izzabella Och: she may even do it for a couple years"""
"here are some direct quotes lol"
lol
yep
"of course it's so  Idon't over react"
obvious
"for some reason I didn't even think of that"
fuck
"so they dont have to deal with it"
"its so you dont over react"
"thats true"
"beating around the bush"
yea
"""only maybe"""
"That's what liars so when they're about to do something bad."
"she says ""it's only a possibility"" and ""it might not be for a year or two"""
"here's the thing"
"that's accomplished"
d
"if she doesn't go to florida"
"thats what is require"
"is geographic separation from her mother"
"my goal"
"wow ""shit just got real"""
"and you just suffering forever"
"i see her not changing"
"i would not be able to live with that"
"her mom can do no wrong"
"I would be ""over reacting"""
"but if I ever pointed any blame on her mom"
yeah
"you're right"
"to deal with this"
hm
oh
"her mom has groomed her"
"thats what stockholm is.  wrong things seem okay."
haha
"Or just obliviousness. Everything is normal to her"
"you talk me through terrible situations, i owe you the same haha.  it sounds like she has Stockholm or something."
"I've always needed an outside voice on this"
"Thank you for discussing this with me. I felt the depression ""weight"" lessen a little bit"
"she would be...you're right about that. She has waited too long to try and get away. Plus I really think having a sociopath do these things to you may make it more of a challenge because of the whole ""charm"" aspect which her mother obviously has."
"She's been brainwashed. You saw how bad it was when I had to escape my mom. That was emotionally traumatizing. Bella is past that point. She would need to be in therapy about it for years."
"of freudian proportions almost"
"everybody loves their mom. but if they're more important than being with someone you ""want to spend your life with"" thats an issue"
"her mom is the most important person in her life"
"so it all sounds like a good idea"
"because they've been best friends their whole life"
"YES IT DID"
"HOLY GOD"
"IT DID"
"worked on bella from her mom"
"we're basically out of hte house"
"it sounds like what my mom TRIED to do to me"
"mom shouldn't be that big of a factor in life planning at age 20"
"like ""you lvoe your mom and I love my mom, but if you want a FUTURE with me you need to pick me"""
"I'm gonna throw this all out there"
"bella can choose"
"but for once"
"her mom is in control"
like
"it is"
"which is bad for me in this situation"
"but this is all bella"
"i wish i had a solution"
=/
"without a question"
no
yes
"you dont even notice other girls?"
"are you so in love with her that everyone else in the world is shut out and she's your entire future and you dream her into your life?"
"let me ask you"
"ah i understand"
"if we broke up"
"could set up more pain"
"but i felt like premature conversation"
"Of course i want it"
"I evaded it"
"that was my decision"
"none of that has been discussed?"
"in 4 years"
"wow thats a red flag"
"stuff like tha"
"she has talked about where were gonna like live after college and stuff in a serious way"
"jsut rip the bandage off"
"maybe it's time to actually discuss that"
"you're right"
yeah
"but maybe"
"I guess"
yeah
"early on,"
"""those big ideas ruin good relationships"""
"I thought"
because
"not once"
"not once in almost four years have the first two come up"
"those are big questions"
"do you want to spend THE REST OF YOUR LIFE with me?"
"do you want kids?"
"do you plan on marrying me?"
"trying to figure out if bella will just have what she wants"
say
"ask her"
"ask bella"
"she's always concerned with what I plan on doing with my life"
"like she's hand picked me to cling to"
"it's really sadistic"
"I've heard her say that shit"
"thats what concerns me"
"that she would PLANT that in bellas head"
"she thinks I'm so wonderful to use"
"but if she hasn't"
"like idk if bellas ever thought that"
"about us like growing up and having kids and things"
"she talks"
"is so manipulative"
"Her mom"
"here's what I hate"
yeah
"because of im assuming her mom"
"yea exactly,  if you were to chart your distance, it would be obvious that she is growing away from you"
"that's not committed enough for florida"
"last two years of high school and first two of college"
"like half our relationship has been long distance"
"for special circumstances too"
right
"a relationship spanning that large of a distance is normally only going to work with people who are 100% committed and have been through a lot together."
"because shes so crippled by her"
"shes willing to give that up for her mom"
"all in charleston"
me
"her life"
"her friends"
"do you know how expensive ANY kind of travel to and from florida is?"
exactly
yes
"she's gonna have to realize that"
"and if she wants to be with me"
"you have to work for it"
"no one is just perfect for you"
"it is"
"because I know that's delusional"
"says that she doesn't truly understand anything"
"the very fact that she thinks she can make us work form florida"
"i want to really discuss all of this"
"next time I see her"
"its not healthy to make emotional decisionns like that"
talking
texting
"long distance"
"let her read it"
"the issue is"
"I will in person"
"but it was literally 20 pages explaining everything that was wrong with our relationship and my life and how we were both affected by it"
"give her the essay"
lol
"Yes I know"
"but I just never did"
"I planned to do something with it"
"explaining all of this"
"i wrote a 20 page essay last summer"
"open the honesty floodgates"
"everything you feel"
"like i said, you need to tell her all of this"
"it's sickening and painful to watch"
"she is in counseling, on therapeutic drugs, because of problems she DOESNT REALIZE WERE CAUSED BY HER MOM. THEREFORE, she NEVER DISCUSSES HER MOM"
"here's the irony"
"she is a victim with a disease, same as a drug addict.  shes probably masochistic or something.  but, people need to get help with their diseases.  she needs to get into counseling and away form her mom."
"she's a victim in a way"
"but its like an affliction"
"theres no convincing otherwise"
"its seriously like"
"thats a great metaphor for what is happening"
"bella is manipulated and under her mothers control, which is essentially what happens when you get too far into doing drugs.  shes being controlled by something that does not care about her."
"lets do that"
"different light"
"and ok"
"like a MASTER or everything she wants to do"
"she is truly something"
"i dont get it"
"and she gets like 1,000 bucks a months for being bipolar"
"lets look at this in a different light"
"dude i deal with so many more serious mental issues than that woman"
"FOLLOW THEM"
"it really is"
so
"thats pitiful"
"and she knows her parents will always give her money"
"she refuses to work or anything"
"its all about her mom getting what she wants"
"and bella said she disagreed"
"and i said that it was a selfish decision"
"but we talkd more about it"
"and she brought it up only for the second time"
"earlier we were skyping"
"i will get to that"
"you need to just say to her, who do you think has your true best interest in mind?"
"shes sucked my soul away"
"my mom thinks she is"
"and for your health, you just stay awya from that"
"her mother sounds like a sociopath"
"you know?"
"i wish people were rational"
"i just"
"or i would have already told you at last some of this"
"im not being dramatic"
"dude there are things i dont even want to share"
"because youve gone through hell"
"man if my mom were like that and you were dealing with it, i would spend my days profusely thanking you for dealing with her and apologizing for her behavior"
"because she doesn't want to accept it"
"and doesn't wanna talk about it"
"or she knows"
"so she either is really too far gone"
"shes never come out and said it"
HOWEVER
"like she appeases her mother and indicates ""she always does this"" and thing slike that. and gets mad when she tries to manipulate me into doing things."
"there's been little hints"
see
"shes already gone"
"i think she realistically should"
"michael if bella cannot look at her mother and distinguish her behavior as manipulative"
"if she was gone for a summer with her grandparents and mom in a retirement community, would she reealize she had made a mistake"
"can they always break away if they really want to?"
"for someone to choose their crazy mother?"
"but how bad does it really have to be?"
"bellas mother is smarter, more powerful, and scarier"
"shes pitiful"
"just slightly"
"she isnt pur eevil"
yes
"i think your mom is truly insane and cruel. however i think she has droplets of humanity that allow her to be human"
"you did"
"this is very similar"
"thats the only way she would be able to make the right choice"
yeah
"i had to stand up for myself"
"i had to make a choice"
"exactly, thats why i had to break away"
"thats not even evolutionary viable. it would be MORE difficult to do that in theory"
"i wouldn't give up a future with someone i love to cater to her needs"
"as much as i love my own mom"
like
"but this is very different"
"I've thought ""please make the right choice"" and she's pulled through"
s
"at time"
"it's just"
"it is"
"youre right"
"and whatever happens, isher choice"
"this is bella's problem"
"because you are powerless"
"this is not your problem"
"im powerless"
"i cant do anything"
"far away"
"but here"
"i would take matters into my own hands"
"i fucking would do it"
"believe me"
"but i'm already over 20,000 in debt"
"that i could make that choice"
"I WISH"
"he would have been"
"and you're right"
"my issue has never been dealing with crazy people. what i didn't realize for years was that it had caused me SIGNIFICANT psychological and emotional damage. When I was in morgantown they wouldnt let me leave the psych center because they thought i was going to kill myself and my roommate. you never think about how much jsut dealing with things does to you"
"he would have been so hurt"
"and leave him, after everything he put up with for me"
"with my mom"
"and if i had wanted to go out of state to college"
yep
"youre right"
god
"he lived with my mom"
"because he has lived your life"
"well, you should maybe discuss this with chris as well"
"m just dealing with that crippling depression where you can't even cry"
I
"she has no true empathy"
"ive watched her for four years"
"she may even be a sociopath"
"bellas mother, has the worst, most mis managed borderline personality ive ever seen"
"thats why im saying"
right
"she onyl let me get away with mild stuff"
"my mom tried that but couldnt be THAT irresponsible"
"the leniency her mother provides is just enough leverage for her to be under her control"
"you have described my thoughts exactly"
exactly
"it seems like her mom cares more about control than her daughter.  she lets her do illegal and immoral things to gain her friendship, so if bella feels like she doesnt like her mom she'll feel guilty because theyre mor elike friends"
"i just cant handle this process of 'what is going to happen/is it going to happen'"
"i know that to be true"
"I'm not being full of myself, but if she stayed with me she'd have a future. If she went with her mom she wouldn't."
"this is all about if bellas strong enough to make the right choice"
"to make sure she'll always win"
"she knows what shes doing"
"and her mom knows that"
"like best friends"
"they interact and behave"
"its rediculous"
"she's so wrapped around her mothers finger"
"see above"
yep.
"let me guess, she'll say youre attacking her mom"
"she's been under her mom's grip for 19 years. I would be the crazy one. Being victimized your whole life is basically a disorder. And I have never shared any of this. I would have to back my claims up and dump all of this on her at once. I've never indicated anything more than annoyance. She has no idea about any of this because she's BLIND to it."
"here's the issue"
"but that last part"
"you're right"
"that her mom is manipulating her"
"and you need to seriously explain to her"
"and if she truly loves you, she'll make it work"
"sometimes you have to sacrifice for what you truly love"
"we would not be together today"
"and if i had not moved into poverty just to be with him"
"well chris can relate"
"and all for nothing"
everything
"always done exactly what she wanted"
"alwyas been polite"
"ive never expressed a single bit of contempt for that woman"
"its been so bottled up inside"
"finally saying a lot of this makes me feel slightly better"
"which is why its so hard for me to let go of it"
"this is the shit i put up with for bella"
"and ill never forgive her for it"
"she is the one who sent me into that mental breakdown"
dude
"shes goddamned psycho"
"not walk out of the bathroom with a towel"
"walk in on me naked"
"she purposely did shit like"
"because she is fucking satan"
"i just wish her mother would show her true colors"
"me or her mother"
"up to bella"
"its ultimately yes"
"if i know her at all shell fight for me. but her mom has such a tight grip around her. its like your mom and you, but about 100 times worse. she is the worst manipulator ive ever met. i used to get sick being in the same room as her"
"or she will fight for you"
"you're right"
"*that's what will happen)"
"fits every EVERY SYMPTOM"
"shes either going to have to choose to follow her mommy for the rest of her life (moving there will prove that that'"
"the worst ive ever seen"
"and she is borderline"
"it is"
"well i think the choice is kind of in her hands right now"
"but she is worse to me"
"its the same kind of shit"
"her mom manipulates her too"
"she doesnt know what family is"
"and bella is so used to it"
"ive lost years of sleep"
"im fucking scarred for life"
"do you understand"
"the only reason ive ever been to therapy"
"thats honest to god"
"every therapist in my life has told me that"
"no its not"
"and she gets to decide the fate of my realtionship"
"in any way"
"BUT THATS NOT HEALTHY FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP"
"I AM SAYING THIS BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AND I CARE ABOUT YOU"
DUDE
"she is a functioning alcoholix"
"WHAT IN THE HELL"
btw
"i saw her suck a dudes dick"
"sending me to the hospital"
"all while laughing in my face"
"she has manipulate me my entire life"
"if it werenot for me bella wouldnt have gone"
"set up bellas college stuff"
"has gotten me to do things for her like clean her house"
"shes too flirty with me"
"and like"
yeah
"THATS INSANE DUDE"
WHAT
"my high school years were psychologically tormenting"
"because she fucked everyone in the building"
"would like run in drunk in the middle of the night asking us for condoms"
"her mom fucking handed me the weed that sent me into a psychotic break"
whatever
like
well
"i wouldnt love her"
"if my mom was so awful"
"which I dont get"
"but shes attatched to her mom at the hip"
"which is good"
"but bella has turned out much better than i thought"
"huge goddamn red flag"
"she does"
"shes disgusting"
"bella has photos of her at allgood as a toddler"
"i mean"
"thats really sad. i always kind of pictured her mom that way honestly."
"will decide the fate of my relationship"
"but that"
"other than something insane like that"
"and why would an adult woman move with her parents"
"ive really thought it through"
"shes moving to florida so she can continue to mooch money off of her parents and party and do what she wants"
"and thats the part that i cant handle"
"is now in charge"
"the perosn i respect least on earth"
"now she gets to decide my relationship"
"she collects disability because shes a high functioning ""bipolar"" and shes always annoyed thefuck out of me, exploited me, taken advantage of me, sent me in and out of therapy, lost my respect, almost ruined my life"
"her mom is selfish"
"i dont think anyone would do that"
just
"and 40 some hour train ride"
"and she loves her dad the most who she takes the train to see all of the time. he lives in baltimore. her family cant afford to fly her around the country"
"it is"
"being so far away, and being young, and loving partying with friends...shes going to meet new people...thats too far for my comfort"
"and go back over break to florida"
"and half in florida"
"she said shed spend half the summer with me"
"i told her that"
"i dont know how that would work"
"but i cant do two days"
hrm
"2 hours away is fine"
"well i mean"
"thats what i dont get"
"she wants to"
no
YEs
"or she's kind of ""meh"" on it"
"so youre saying she IS wanting to continue long distance?"
"but she acts like it can still work if she moves to florida"
"its not even definite"
"or overly emotional"
"or insane"
"i don't know if im being realistic"
"I knew thast"
1)
"thats the best advice you could have given me"
2)
"it makes you hate your relationship"
"I'm not happy because i'm so far away from her"
3)
"all of the things i hate about her are the things i like. i wish i was more like her in a way, but i cant be. i've always felt like the relationship was two halves of one level headed human being"
"3) you arent really 100% happy with where her life is headed anyways"
"its just"
"i understand"
"2) i dont really believe in god but i do believe in fate somewhat, and in my experience, a terrible heart break or death can make way for the birth of something wonderful"
"1) i kind of saw this coming, because as ive said before, i could not see you spending your life with a type of person such as her (not derogatory, you know what i mean)"
yes
"can i be honest with you about this situation from a level view?"
"aw man =[[["
"i cant even comprehend this"
"thats a crock of shit"
"but that shit"
"she says shes not worried"
"bellas dead beat mother is going to move to florida with her parents this summer, and bella has tog go as well obviously. shes moving to florida.  the only time i get witht her is over the  summer. it's basically over"
"nooo whats wrong? D:"
"im so depressed i dont know if i can type"

 lordmacbayne:  Correct

 lordmacbayne:  Its probably more debilitating on the whole
 me:  Do you just not like to talk about it?
 Sent at 7:16 PM on Thursday

jajaja
"I dunno honestly dude"
"lets just say that anyone who talks to me and enjoys it on a daily basis has SOME issues"

"anyone who behaves outrageously is easy to pin as borderline if you know the disease"

"It's hard not to think that"
"hes manipulative"
"but thats just me"
"i think that he suffers from BPD"
"has delusions of grandeur ====== manic episode."
randomly
"and also"
"he's flat"
YEAH
"some kind of cycling disruption would explain how erratic he is"
"he is also very depressed, and that is i believe why he acts so flat sometimes"
"he definitely is"
"thats why he acts like this, thats why i talk to him"
haha
"OH yeah"
"he is sick"
"well i totally believe that someone diagnosed him, because psychs tell everyone theyre fucking bipolar"
"like is he sick for real?"
"he really seems like someone I've known my whole life. Like someone who would just say that."
"is he actually though"

haha
"i know i know him but i dont know which ""him"" that i know"
"you know him"
"You have to mkae that call"
"otherwise its just garbage and i dont want any of it"
"because if he actually means the nice things he says to me, that is good, i need to hear nice things about me"
"are these real feels that he has, which i can respect and work around, or is this him just trying ANYTHING to get laid?"
"now the actual question is"
"he does seem like that"
hahahahahahah
"it seems almost like when it comes down to it, and im really upset, he wants to be that ""a shoulder to cry on is a dick to rid eon"" guy.  and let me laugh at that. hahahahaha"

only certain ones though
i still hate the majority all of the time

 me:  im in this paradox where im working around your paradox.  i try to talk to you to kind of ""vent"", i guess, but i can only talk to you so much, because too much interaction just shuts you down haha
or rather, too much of my interaction
im sure im more bothersome than a lot of people
im not dumb, just neurotic
 lordmacbayne:  You're a lovely person
Do not fret"
alright
"let me show you the level of mixed messages i am getting"
MK
"but before that"
"im going to read your stuff when i get home"
Fantastic
"i think i made him understand"
"i think so"

"Do you feel like he'll continue doing things like that?"
"I'm glad he did that"
"That's good"

"I'm not trying to be pushy at all lol"
"you can read them whenever you feel like it"
"via email"
"wait did you send them to me already?"
"if you are willing, tell me after you read them whenver you do, and I can send you one more thing that REALLY helps"
"okay, i can definitely read them"
"If you really take in what they say"
"I think they would be helpful"
"It's just two little pages of info. My therapist gave me identical ones a long time ago"
lol
"i can try"
"If I sent you two things would you take them seriously?"
yeah
"thats all i can do"
?
"and wait."
"and do just that"
"then maybe provide what you can"
"the best thing to do for an over stressed reptile is to just leave it be"
"but thats it"
"try to help it"
nothing
"well what can you actually do about that?"
hm
"sometimes bad things happen without you being at fault"
"one of them might be sick, i paid 500 dollars for it and had it shipped to me from washington.  it got here a couple of days ago and looks to be dying."
"You have to realize"
"try just watching them really closely and seeing if they behave funnny or anything. Something could be irritating them, or god forbid they could actually be sick or something right?"
hm
well
ok
"that's why you should double check"
"and losing weight"
"i have two geckos in partcular that are starving themselves"
"I know you do"
"i know all of this"
"or maybe biological. A lot of animals eat less during times when they plan to mate."
"make sure there's nothing environmental that could be stopping them from eating"
"Maybe double check everything and see if that helps"
"it shouldnt be"
"maybe, i couldnt know"
"could it be temperature? or something environmental?"
"they use all of this other shit that i have tried that didnt work"
"what do other people use?"
"What do you think is up really?"
"Let's talk about the food"
"because you aren't"
"or i will have to go to my car and cry"
"i cannot break down HOW i am a faqilure"
"Okay, say you are. Specifically, how?"
"like what realistic things could that be"
"im just shitty at my job"
"other than ""you failing with the food"""
"What could be going wrong?"
hm
"thats like, tiny."
"my biggest hatchling is 4 grams"
"my competition bred a gecko and raised it to adulthood in one year"
"except for me"
"because every other fucking breeder has geckos that eat like pigs"
"im getting like nauseous thinking about having to re-buy all these fucking diets and mix and match and hope that one day ill find a food that every one of them will eat"
"Maybe they would just like something else"
"The only way you could know that is if they told you that's not the way they like it, and they can't talk."
"so im hoping they just think the food is shit"
"the other reasons would be environment related, meaning i dont house them properly"
"thats the only reason"
"i didnt make it the way they like"
"I bet you can"
"can you think of a better reason for them not eating than you failing?"
"they probably just don't like it anymore"
"you probably are"
"i feel like a failure for having to go back to powdered diets for my animals because im not good enough at making them food"
"you're just upset"
sometimes
"you can't fix upset so easily"
"well yea"
good
"but like right now, im strill upset"

"he didnt actually blow me off, im just sensitive"
"but, in different ways"
"hes reliable"
"but he's stilla friend"
"he's a friend, but he's not easy"
that
"accept taht"
"if he's not a reliable friend"
"then expect nothing from him"
"would be the same as expecting nothing"
"expecting less of josh"
"just expect less of people"
"don't do that"
no
"i guess i should just start expecting to be abandoned and let down"
"but you should learn to not idealize people as much I guess"
"It's probably not as healthy"
"but it's easier"
"I'm not telling you that alone is better"
"but mostly I'm alone"
"I have a bunch of really distant friends that I see quarterly"
"that's a tough way to be"
"you have to break away from that"
"he is"
"because im afraid of everyone leaving me"
"any person who can be a constant in my life, i grab onto"
"i dont know anymore, hes become a constant in my life"
"i dont know"
"i mean"
hahaha
"(OLD VIRGIN)"
"he's too emotionally infantile to admit it"
"but he's one of those people you just have to ""know it"""
"you have to know it"
exactly
"so therefor, i have no clue"
"but he would never want me to know that"
"i feel like secretly i know that he values me as a person a lot"
"and I LOVE it"
"and I know I'm being constructive and condescending all at once"
"I know he values your friendship"
semantics
DAMN
"You are more to him than that"
"I mean"
"you are more to that than him"
"no other girl would be interested in talking to him"
"I Don't believe him"
"so really, maybe im just some girl"
"If you worry that it's prbably true"
"but then he started talking about all these other girls that he talks to on a daily basis im assuming"
"""i just worry that he takes up too much of my life compared to how much of his i take up"""
"i felt like it was pretty even sided"
"because it's not lob sided"
"like he can't offend you at all"
"so it doesn't get weird"
"level out the friendship"
"adjust it accordingly"
"If you worry about that"
well
"yeah or you wouldn't be friends with a dick"
"i guess"
"i just worry that he takes up too much of my life compared to how much of his i take up"
obviously
"im also masochistic"
"but i have this addictive personality and i have to cling to people"
"i feel just wrong in every way for even caring"
"*NUTS*
*GO*"
"it drives me"
"without acting 17"
"he should have conversations with you"
"or a child"
"he shouldn't be such a dick"
"he's 36"
"and I'm like"
"you tell me things that he says to you"
"it's just"
"I TRIED"
"well yes we knew all of this already, this isnt news haha"
"I'm gonna be honest with you. I liked hanging out with you and josh, I respect that he's your friend, but I will never truly like him like I'd like to. Not because I think something will happen between the two of you, he's just got a dreadful personality. I think your drawn to that in a way. It makes him interesting"
"that's so stupid"
"so i feel guilty about it"
"and he doesnt like when i talk a lot"
"and i need to talk to feel better"
"because hes like my therapist in many ways"
"i feel abandoned"
"discovered it"
"this is it"
omg
"i dont know, i think i try to treat him"
"that is weird"
"which was weird"
"He is such a flip flopper"
"He doesn't want things to get weird"
"I think"
"He's just trying to set up a boundary"
"""i cant give you all of my attention all of the time"""
"and he said"
"he made sure to tell me that part"
"and he HATES it"
"he says i just go on about things"
but
"he also said im quiet"
"i feel bad because josh says i talk too much"
"because in person i would just cry too much to even talk"
"oh internets"
"and it works better over the internet"
"i mean thats basically what i need"
haha
"which we do constantly"
"about everything"
"Which is just talking incesively"
"Talk therapy"
"You know what the best treatment for BPD is?"
"I know"
"I know"
"instant sadness"
"like my stomach just drops"
"but when someone abandones me its like the worst feeling int he world"
"i know thats just my BPD"
"i feel abandoned =/"
"Or he's just got poor social skills"
haha
"I swear"
"He's just doing that"
"hes like, stop bullshitting around it and just say it"
"I think he just likes to get a rise out of you"
"and if i try to say something without just saying it"
"he's blunt"
"hes not mean"
"eh usually"
"that tends to be his personality right?"
YEah
"Oh I see"
"Why is that?"
"or ""why do you care?"""
"because he would be like, we never talked about it"
"but i cant even say anything to him"
"a winking sigh"
like
"I hate this ;/"
:/
;/
"Im sorry"
"now i just feel depressed"
"that i verbaled"
yes
hahaha
"that aint word"
"THAT YOU VERBALED"
"it wasnt really verbal, we didnt talk about it, it was assumed based on past behaviors"
"Like most girls I know"
"and you aren't annoying"
"because we internet"
"sometimes I forget you're a girl also"
"I forget that verbal commitments are important to girls"
"and i made a point to talk to him about an hour before he left, so he wouldnt forget that im his friend and that we hang out sometimes"
"I'm not trying to be mean"
"im not mad, im hurt"
lol
"so you wanna say that he did"
"you're just mad"
"He probably didn't"
"you're over thinking it"
"I mean"
"and he just blew me off"
"hes the only person here that i dont dislike being around"
"and im upset"
"being honest though, i feel kind of ""dissed"" right now"
"I know"
"I know"
"but i do it all day long"
"is pretty okay"
internetting
hahaha
"that's easy"
"I internet you"
"This is the way I live"
"and I don't want anyone else to have it or get pleasure from it"
"It's DIFFICULT"
"human interaction blows"
"I don't much like that"
"i dont know i just was looking forward to some human interaction D:"
lol
"i mean, ive done it before because i thought he was being pissy with me, for like 3 days, and i finally got too bored and just told him that i thought he was mad at me, and he was like, nope"
"NO EXPERIMENT IS WORTH THAT"
"you shouldn't if it's gonna make you bored"
"i just get so bored and chris doesnt care"
"but i dont think i can"
"and see what happens"
"i should stop talking to him"
"i think that maybe"
CONNECTIONS#
"so i guess thats why im upset, he knows hes the only one here today that i talk to"
"who is weird"
"but not atypical for josh"
"that's super weird"
"and chris is gone too"
"but he just bounced"
"but i just expected that he would maybe say something"
"and i didnt want to make him lie to me"
"right, i didnt want to ask him because if he doesnt want to do something he usually will lie about why"
"he's like a shadow creature"
"he's usually not one to inform you of everything"
"maybe he was just tired"
"and maybs you're over thinking it"
"but this time, i was talking to him on gmail and he didnt seem super intrerested, stopped talking to me, and just left"
"maybe he was busy today"
"like, he seeked me out for that"
"the one time, he came over here and i wasnt at my desk, and he had sent me on gmail ""break?"""
"USE YOUR BRAIN JOSH"
"well like"
haha
"just being human"
"Its seriously"
"I say ""thats basic human behavior"" as if it's a science."
"you should still be ineterested"
"if one day they don't ask"
"OVER and OVER"
"someone asks you to do something"
like
"that's basic human behaiovr"
no
"am i that lame?"
"and he didnt"
"and i assumed he would just come get me or something"
"i didnt ask today"
"in this flesh world"
"well that's true"
"and i usually ask him to hang out"
"Not in this flesh world"
"so, every thursday josh leaves at 5 and i stay until 7:30"
"i know no one"
"not really though"
"i know a guy"

Okay?
"omg lololol"
"Two butteefongers?"
hahaha
"not just one"
"i ate 2 of them at work"
well
"What are you talking about"
"i guess ill eat it later but 3 butterfingers seems excessive"
No
N9
"now i feel kind of shitty because i was saying earlier that i wanted a butterfinger, and i ate two of them, and then i guess chris actually bought me a butterfinger"
"That's not okay"
"Which you shouod"
"which, if thats the case, if eel insulted and violated"
"but im also afraid that hes reading this right now and waiting for me to just repeat to him what hes already seen"
"i feel like i need to tell chris to do this stuff"
"As like part of treatmnet"
"And be more social"
"I had to go out with friends"
"The situation was similar in a way"
"That's how I got over it"
"I had to go to therapy"
"I've done something similar"
"i dont know"
"or something"
"but it likes he never got over it"
"im sorry but i just feel like the josh thing should have upset him, he shouldve gotten over it, and life should have just kept on rolling"
"I've put bella in situations like that. But a year later realized how untrue my accusations were."
"and that was kind of hurtful"
"yesterday he insinuated that if josh hadnt blown me off when i went after him (for like 10 seconds) that i absolutely would have had sex with him"
"it was probably josh"
"or somehow it was josh"
"or if my BPD did it"
"i dont know if my mom broke him"
"something like died inside him"
"that's a good point"
"something did"
"what changed"
"he used to be so different"
"he always said to me, why do you read my FB messages?  whenever he would be flirting with other girls and i would get upset.  he would tell me, i dont read yours because i dont want to be disappointed, so dont read mine."
"so I never did it again"
"and wanted to DIE"
"I did it once"
"I would  be constantly upset"
"if I read things that bella said to her friends about me"
"im sure he isnt readin right now, surely he would have become embarrassed after i called him out"
like
"because you've recently (like months) spoken about how he's so flat and to me seems depressed"
"why do you think that?"
yeah
"all he does is choose to be depressed and feel bad"
"I'm kinda feeling that he reads more of our conversations than you think"
"He could turn it around and do things , or just be depressed all of the time and feel inadequate"
"I mean if he actually reads them one of two things could happen"
"because i would be less weary of that"
"i think he reads the ones i send you"
"so instead of reading those"
"i dont think he even reads my josh messages anymore, because his thought process is ""hunter thinks im going to read these messages so she wont do/say anything that would upset me"""
"(so YUM)"
but
HAHAHAHAHA
"*shoots and kills 20 dogs*"
"oh lawd"
"I am the NRA"
hahaha
"i know"
"I meant NSA"
hahahaha
"close enough"
NSA
"he is the NRA"
"""should I take that into consideration and be weary of his feelings?"""
"I would be constantly thinking ""is he watching now?"""
"dude that's so unhealthy in a relationship"
"and i just feel trapped"
"the tighter his grip on me becomes, the less i can breath"
"but IT HAPPENED"
"never maniacally"
"I used to log in to my girlfriends accounts when I was in high school because it was cute to share passwords lololol"
"like, im sure he thinks im going to run away to wherever with josh in his twisted nightmare fantasy"
haha
"(my loud opinion)"
"(just my opinion)"
"never okay"
"I'LL MONITOR YOUR CONVERSATIONS WHEN THINGS SEEM FISHY"
"or some shit"
"does he think he's your superior"
"when he feels something is up"
"he should TALK TO YOU"
"i dont know that he watches me all day"
no
no
no
no
"all day"
"he only does it when he ""feels like something is up["""
"He just sits and obssesses over you"
"but now it's like"
"Like a minute ago it was different"
"come on"
"and it's fucking pathetic that he sits there logging into your shit"
"I still don't see how that's justified"
"and if i change one he figures it out"
"and now he wants all of my passwords"
"so eventually he threw a huge fit, deleted his FB, started a new one with a fucking alias, and gave me the password"
"is because at the beginning of our relationship he flirted with all kinds of girls and when id log nto his FB he would change his password"
"but the reason i do it"
"DON'T DO THAT"
"THAT IS NOT HEALTHY BEHAVIOR"
OK
"i mean maybe that would inspire him to do something you want"
"or he loses his mind"
"i have to give him all my passwords"
"but he can watch whatever he wants"
"i dont know that for a fact"
"i have suspected this entire time that chris is monitoring all of my conversations"
"and you know what"
:/
"because i know if i dont, i will have to help make dinner"
"and i have to remind him"
"i told him earlier i want pasta for dinner, when he asked"
"hm ok I see"
"so his standards are LOW"
"and he grew up with them"
"i mean, ive seen the way his parents live"
"before me, he lived with some other girl who im assuming did the work in the house"
"was that how he was before you?"
"he would probably live in filth with only disposable silverware and he would re-wear his clothes until they fell apart"
"does he simply . depend on you?"
"could he even function?"
well
yes
"oh like how would he take care of himself"
like
no
"like, what does he do all day at home?"
"if you weren't there"
hypothetically
"what would he do"
"he shaves his face above the sink and gets beard hair all over it, and i have cleaned that sink im almost positive 100% of the time since we moved in there"
"it would never happen though, because in order for chris to RECOGNIZE that something needs to be done, i have to ask him to do it"
"or some total"
"that would be nice"
lol
"maybe ill walk in and the house will be cleaned and there will be food for me"
total
"yeah I know"
"i go home in like half an hour"
"in a sense"
yes
"did a god say that?!"
wait
hahahahaha

"Here's something chris told me which may explain everything"
"and that never happens"
"the only reason i remembered was probably because chris cried"
"i forget about it all the time"
HAHA
really
"so hard"
"REALLY forgot about that"
"and I"
"but i basically told him about it"
"but I know whatyou mean"
"it does"
hahaha
"which sounds stupid when i say it"
"and then he cried when he found out i cuddled with shayn"
"I'm not sure how to respond to that much emotion"
wow
"i remember the first time, he was crying because he was upset that he left his gf and her family (for me), and i just sat there and held him, even though he was crying because of me"
"there's nothing you can do about him bein sad"
"like yell if he doesn't get it"
"My advice is to be REALLY up front with him"
well
ugh
"ive only seen him cry i think twice"
"but now i feel kind of like shit, like im going to go home and chris is going to be so upset that hes puking or something"

yeah
"yea we luckily were able to see some normal people"
"I take it chris didn't"
"especially in relationships"
"Like we saw adults and knew how to behave"
"but that doesnt mean anything"
"it's like explaining to someone with borderline that they have BPD. it's the most unwilling mental illness there is.  Explaining to chris what exactly is wrong and why it's wrong is going to be seemingly impossible if he didn't learn what normal right and wrong were. Even though they were fucked up, the both of us had relationships to model in a way."
"he says he'll change something"
"something does"
yes
something
"whether it's his behavior, or mental status"
"something has to really change"
"but he's in an adult relationship now"
"he's obviously fragile"
"I mean"
yeah
"make sure he knows that"
"im really not"

very
yes

"I'd like it"
"but If a sad movie makes me feel sad in a good way"

I've never understood why people want to be sad or afraid."""

"like how he doesn't get social cues, emotions, ect very easily"
"if he's not depressed there could be some weird underlying developmental problem"
but
"All of them could"
"See a lot of his issues could be attributed to STRAIGHT clinical depression."
"not always"
"Can he understand the emotions of others very well? like can he tell when you're upset without you saying anything? ect"
"he feels so LITTLE of the emotinoal spectrum"
"They're like autistic. Usually, people just PRETEND those things and those people are messed up"
"if they do"
"no one has those feelings"
"he hates movies that have a good plot and feelings"

"He won't give the slightest bit of effort"
"thats about it right now, because i am genuinely upset about this"
"once you get past the part about him dealing with me and on occasion my mom"
"what is there to respect?"

"that's very true"
"to become something better"
"for us"

"shes very interested in things that dont matter"
"and she just doesnt care"
"in some way"
"make an impact"
"you come from something different, youve had enough experiences that you are an old soul, you are ambitious, you want to be SOMEONE, you want to make something out of your life here"

"to me"
"ILL TAKE IT"
"but SHOOT"
"I know what it is because I've had friends and therapists tell me for years."
"want my opinion?"
"but is it worth ending a relationship over that even if it is big"
"I can't tell if my complaints are big...like I don't think we're each other's type, I don't respect her career choices, I don't trust her for some reason"
haha
"yea i can deal with it"
"but really nothing"
"bothersome to you"
"not a big deal at all"

"IS THAT okay in a relationship?"
hahahaha
"The question of the day:"
"but not as involved, and we don't like that they don't have goals like that"
"yes very much so"
"our significant others are supportive"
"we both have goals that we want to get to eventually"
"think about this"
"Because I'm an obsessive compulsive type a personality who tries to make the best of relationships because I don't value them enough to seek them out because I'm focused on something more important"
haha
"you havent really been with anyone who is"
"because shes not your type"
"i never got it"
"i mean"
"that why i kind of was always like"

"I've never looked at it in terms of myself as well though"
"I get that"
"in my decisions"
RIGHT
"he supports me"
"i can settle with the fact that chris lets me always be as ambitious as i want, financially"
"our relationships are similar"
"this part of our dynamic is just coming to light"
"a lot"
"I am -___-"
"i also value ambition"
"so youre just like me haha"
"because whilst thinking about it last night, I realized I'm completely not her type and it bothers me. Like I'm attracted to people with ambition and she is so obviously attracted to people with long hair who ride long boards and draw"
"is there an obligation to talk to your significant other"
"what is your motive? haha"
"just not doing it"
like

"ITS BEEN YEARS"
"I'm trying to think of other things"
"especially if they don't have clipped wings and you have fans. Also chocolate, avocados, and several kinds of nuts can kill them. (basically dog amirite) they obviously like to explore so just make sure you're aware of where it is when you have it out of its cage. I've heard horror stories of people lying down on them or accidentally stepping on them"

"this just happened..."
so
hey
"hey mayne"
"okay, will do"
"Ok, well, I have to go, just try your best not let any of these things get to you"
"but obviously it is going to come into your mind"
"without a doubt"
"I know you wouldn't"
"i do and i wouldnt do that to chris again"
"But that's not something I want to let happen to you because you deserve better"
"I know"
"and it's especially hard for me because i know an instant way to happiness"
"If he hasn't up to this point, and you know you've been doing good work, he may never say it. And you probably are getting worked a lot, but it may have something to do with how well you do it. The feeling of being worked to the bone may be influenced by how you're feeling right now as well. And also, the fact that he says that is kind of a symbol of trust right? He knows that you aren't going to just give up after he leaves, he trusts that you are good at your job and trusts you"
"as hes walking to leave, he doesnt even stop, he just says ""hunter, hold down the fort"" and leaves me"
"he does i know but he ever tells me and i feel like im getting worked to the bone"
"Just not in the way that you're used to."
"Maybe he doesn't appreciate you, but odds are he probably does in some way if you do your job well."
"People are not inherently evil, they do have trouble expressing themeselves though"
"That's just a certain way of thinking. Some people just don't say that. What you have to remember, is that doing a good job is a good job nonetheless, and even though he doesn't say it, he probably acknowledges to himself that you do good work"
well
ok
"My boss just gives me all the fucking work and never says good job, he just shows me what I do wrong"
"Well. Do you think I respect you? Chris? Josh? People that you do business with?"
Ok
"he's emotionally a child, remember this"
"I feel disrespected and like I don't matter"
"what the hell"
"And of courae josh just sends me a link to a stupid photo of a fossil"
"What are you sad about, TODAY? Like what is making you want to cry?"
"I getcha"
Yeah
"sometimes you just are"
"It's just hard to not cry at work"
"you realize that it's silly and try to get reason to defeat the sadness, because you shouldn't be sad. But the reality is, you don't have to rationalize or be sorry for an emotion no matter the circumstances"
"And I don't know how"
"I mean I just want to be happy"
"that's how it works"
"What's frustrating is that I know the things that get to me are stupid and I've already whined about them a million times"
"the best thing for you to do (since therapy isn't an option) is just to talk about what's making you sad. Just talk at me whenever you need to. I'm not gonna sit here and try to fix it, but I'll listen"
"Antidepressants have made me worse. I smoke weed at that helps."
"you take antidepressants right?"
"I have been and it annoyed me when people tried and couldn't help"
"right. It's impossible to be on same page as someone who's depressed"
"Yea I know, it's just like...you can't help"
"that's why I'm not offering"
"the offer doesn't mean much"
"No one can really help when you're depressed"
"No one really cares"
"Josh doesn't really care"
"Chris is all concerned and wants I help but he can't"
"I have been there in a different way"
"im so low"

"i dont know"
"Why though"
"but he hates me"
"i dont even talk to him"
"And HE DOES NO MATTER"
"i think he egged my car too"
"Valid point"
"probably shayn"
"who would know what ""dox"" means"
no
"Ever think maybe it was just kaitlyn because you called her out?"
"But seriously that's such a high school thing to do"
"I know"
"i want to go home but i cant"
"just emotional abuse"
"because this is what i lived through my whole life in school and at my stepmom's"
"i try to never make a sound or draw attention to myself for this reason"
"I KNOW YOU DO"
"i lay so low it's ridiculous"
"It's just so disgusting that people take time to engage in that behavior"
Really
"You don't have enemies"
"You're personable you do your job well you're  interesting"
"It's hard to believe"
"No one hates you that much"
"i want to die"
"they were just calling me a fat ugly bitch"
"but according to the person who sent it to me"
"i dont even know who did it"

"Your pam"
"Oh my gos"
"no one came except for people that chris works with"
"i invited everyone to my reptile show"
"and would steal money from me if he could"
"martin is mean to me"
"i really dont know man"
"I'm not disputing that. I just think you're more than ""a body in a chair"" to your coworkers"
"I mean you could get more respect I agree"
"Sounds a little distorted. I'm sure that's not true!"
"im just a body in a chair"
"no one in my department cares if i live or die"
"and gave a shit"
"if people actually helped me"
"i wuold be fine doing this job"
"I wish you could do something you enjoyed more"
"theres like 2"

"HOLY CHRIST"
"oh no"
"holy MOTHER OF GOD"
"or something"
"i hate being around people, but ill do it because i dont want him to think im a drunken asshole"
"okay cool"
"because he will probably say something like"
"let me see how he reacts to a statement and not a question"
"ii told him he should eat with us"
"i know it does feel crazy but it's all accurate"
"this all fits to perfectly not to be true right? It feels stupid, but it fits"
"he looks up to you in some weird way"
"and just left early"
"he went to stupid lunch with me"
"oh yeah"
"and instead of going into work to supervise his department"
"the roads were covered in like 3 inches of ice"
hahahaha
"wait what"
"he WENT INTO WORK LATE during what he called a CRISIS because he had alkready planned to have lunch with me"
hahaha
"if I don't get the upper hand I drop people. I don't manage it. I NEED it to survive relationships"
dude
"yea to an extent he will do whatever"
"i LAWAYS manage the upper hand in every situation, its a part of my own issues haha, but i feel like he doesnt want me mad at him secretly or something"
"you can probably get him to do whatever you want to an extent"
"you do have the upper hand"
but
"don't abuse your power"
yeah
"I just realized"
GOD
"now thats out the window, i can say what i want"
"HOLY GOF"
"when we first started talking he said to never ask anything of him or tell him to do anything"
"and it will go over better because i think he takes well to commands?"
"i can say ""so you should go out and eat with michael and i"" instead of asking"
"no im going to tell him, because where the roles have slightly reversed"
"im going to ask him"
"and he told me that he would maybe be interested in doing another 1st impression on you, for my sake (as if he could look any better than he did shit faced hahaha)"
"being the third party"
"getting to watch him in his element"
"that's the BEST PART"
absoLUTELYYYYYY
"because we're hanging out monday, you and i"
ohhhhh
"now...do you think you could contain your protests long enough to sit and have lunch with him?"
*Laughs*
"I'm gonna skim through the diagnostics manual and see what looks good"
"go go go!"
"go team!"
"its pretty hilarious"
go
"*team button*"
"I feel like diagnosing him with a disorder is the funnest thing I've done in a while"
"I can search through our facebook convos"
"and you just compile a list and what each statement says abouthis thinking"
"for a 36 year old"
"i can tell you things he says that are odd"
hahaha
"start taking notes man"
hahah
"and go over it"
"I wish I could access everything we've talked about him and organizee it"
"NOT QUITE THERE"
hahaha
"I feel like its just"
"and yes we are"
"We've figured out the symptoms"
"WE ARE A GREAT TEAM"
"we finally figured out the disorder"
"anyways, we have finally figured it out"
"I getcha"
hahahahaa

"that shits hilarious"
"but cmon"
"i dont want him to be hurt"
exactly
"is funny"
"and who it happened to"
"how it happened"
"the injury isn't funny"
"think about it happening"
just
"and almost laughed in his face"
"and i imagined it"
"he fell and hurt his shoulder at work apparently, ripped a tendon or something, slipped on ice"
"just like everything else"
yep
"but it probably went right through his head"
yeah
"oh had to have"
"she had to have told him to grow up"
"but i know she didnt just NOT tell him that hes a child"
"you're rigt"
"and thats probably why she left him"
"i mean, i feel like his GF (because she is married with children) was somewhat of an adult"
"i dont know what could do anything to him"
"I'd have to look more into it"
"you'd be surprised what kinds of exposure therapy do to people. Coming to this grand catharsis."
"what would be so convincing that he would snap out of it?  what could possibly do that?"
"there's the issue"
like
"that's what I was gonna say"
"well i mean"
"he would hate me and shut me out"
"but he would snap into reality"
"and it would be traumatizing"
"and force him to face what he really is"
"Like we'd have to correct his cognitive distortions"
"It's some kind of exposure therapy"
"do you know what the therapy is?"
"yes please that sounds so fun!!!!"
"there's some kinds of cognitive behavioral therapy that can fix this and we could half ass it and see if it works as a fun experiment"
"HOLY SHIT HE COULD BE"
"I'd like to do some research"
"and that he could be my fucking dad"
"and he is a 36 year old"
"because at some point he will realize that i am a 20 year old"
"but maybe i could help accelerate his ""growing up""?"
"now tell me if im crazy"
"i feel like maybe"
HAHAHAHA
"HEY YOU'RE LIVING IN A DREAM WORLD: HERE'S PROOF"
"think about it"
lol
"but it could damage him even more I think"
"not only would he not grasp the extent of it"
though
"dude telling him all of this would be so bad"
HAHAHA
hahaha
"WE ARE ONE"
"yes exactly.  i cant use all my brain at once so if i use one part you can convey thoughts from the other"
"'collective brain'"
"and because we have the same brain but not the same conscious mind I can tell you what the collective brain is doing while your caught up in something and vice versa"
RIGHT
"youre never wrong because we have the same brain"
"I know I know"
"because I don't hear ""your wrong"" so there's no basis"
"im never mocking you"
hahaha
"sometimes i can't tell if you're mocking me or actually telling me I'm right"
"for now he remains unaware of the testing."
"catch 22"
dammit
"but hes a child and wuoldnt understand"
"i want to tell him all of this"
"but he didn't have that until recently"
right
"omg youre so fucking"
no
"and we're like"
"then we hit 18"
"OHHH THEY WERE THE ONE"
"we obsessess"
"our first adult relationships as teens"
"WE ALL DO THAT"
"his first adult relationship he's still dwelling on at 36"
"or I GUESS psychosexually"
sexually
"he wasn't that age until 26"
"the average person has sex between 15-17, he's like at least ten years younger than he is"
"if say in 2014"
like
"think about it"
"because he actually is"
"I'm going to continue making him seem like a juvenile"
HAHAHAHAHA
"are we at a college town sleezy bar and are you ordering another beer"
hahahaha
"*shrinking and dying im not here*"
"im just like"
"the waiter is like, can i get you some more coffee?  and josh goes yea, then take like 10 seconds to CHUG what was left in his mug, and then hands to mug to the guy."
"OH AND GET THIS"
"i dont know i felt like when i was eating with him and talking to the waiter that i was eons nicer to the waiter than he was, and he KNEW the guy from eating there so much"
"he like"
"thats really fitting, because thats how it seems"
"but you're the older person"
"the younger person trying to get the older person to do something stupid"
"it's like a role reversal type situation"
"that's not to explain him though"
"You are overly mature"
"because I'm around people my age a LOT and they're like josh and have the same philosophies and crap"
"that IM not just overly mature?"
"so how do i know"
"oh shit"
"we think like people who are his age"
"HERES WHATS WEIRD"
"I take issue with darwin obviously haha"
"Either he has a younger mind set, is obsessed with Darwin (who by the way was a racist idiot when we're talking about humans) or BOTH"
"That's a childish motto"
"i was like, but i am enough for chris.  and he said, well maybe if chris is odd.  but most people fool around.  and i said, i could never do that, i need the emotional connection.  and he was like, some people say that, and some people such as yourself mean it, but what people say and what they do are different"
"also wow to him saying that. 'wow'"
"he's not without morals, he's just a fucking teen basically hahaha"
"very Darwinistic"
"21 year male logic"
"he said ""cheating is normal"""
"and i wanted to be like, why say that"
"dude the other night, maybe last night, he was trying to explain to me how im probably not enough for chris and that cheating is normal"
"that makes SO MUCH SENSE"
seriously
"SPOT ON M8"
WOW
"but there's like some driving sexual force"
"He likes you as a friend"
"people our age, (normal people not us) hang out with large groups of people, flirt, flirt with their friends, have sex with their friends, nothing really matters in that sense. He's being playfully flirtatious like a 21 year old would be around ANY female friend because they wouldn't be able to resist"
"think about this:"
haha
"it's childish flirting"
"but i ignore it"
"i mean he borderline flirts with me sometimes to the point where i just want to ask, WHAT IS YOUR MOTIVE YOU CRAZY CHILDMAN"
"usually not super kind"
"anyone else his age, with his position would be condescending. He's in a higher position, but not the highest. Middle management age 30-50 tends to have this overtly-masculine superiority complex"
wow
"thinkg about it"
like
RIGHT
"or something weird"
"which seems like....he was trying to be like ""i know how you feel because im also young"""
"and he was just like, dont call yourself dumb because of your age"
"when we first started talking, i spoke to him like he was my superior, because he is"
haha
awesome
"oko k"
but
"heres something i didnt pick up on"
hmmm
really?
also
"i just notice that age is NEVER a conversation we have"
"has made this whole situation 100000 times better"
"he really really doesnt...."
"This realization"
"but he doesn't realize how old he is"
"should treat you as lesser"
"someone with HIS PERSONALITy"
right
"you wanna think it's because he's so mature and respectful, and sees you for you. However, you know he's none of those things so why would he be towards you in that way? He feels like he's your age"
"he should treat me like im below him, an agent"
see
"i know this because he treats me no differently than he would another supe"
"he sees us as peers"
"but maybe he just doesnt see it"
"why he is okay with going out places with me, because h is obviously an old dude"
"sometimes i wonder"
"it makes sense"
"(again, opinion)"
"Yeah basically that's why you get along so well"
"my age"
...
"so mentally hes like"
"his pre-pubescent-like obsession with sex"
"his angst"
"his behavior"
"that explains his manners"
jesus
"youre so spot on"
"I'm not over how weird it is"
wow
just
wow
"but seriously"
"kind of kidding"
"I think that's a developmental delay. That's partly why he's weird, and socially retarded. Everything is happening late for him. Sex. The realization that god isn't real. Being Emo."
"WHATS THE POINT"
"how do you have girlfriends when youre not allowed to have sex?"
"you fuckin weirdo"
HOW
"and im like...."
"because one day he said, today is the 10th anniversery of the death of my virginity"
"THAT DOESNT HAPPEN"
"i know!  i was just like....WAT"
"that's unbelievable dude!"
ahahaha
"that might be a serious developmental delay. Maybe that's part of his insanity"
HAHA
YES
"when he was 26"
hahahaha
"HAHA THAT STATEMENT"
"he lost it in 2004"
"i told you"
"was he oddly old when he lost his virginity then"
"and im just like....how did you make it into your late twenties before you realized you were nuts"
wait
"because of jesus"
"yea and he called her ""unnamed girlfriend"" because at this point he wasnt allowed to have sex"
WTF
like
"That's an awful story for like 100 reasons HAHAHAHa"
"OMG TOO FUNNY"
HAHAHAHAHA
"and his gf at the time told him to try not eating meat"
"don't sit on your ass weaving dream catchers and eating bread"
"he said he used to eat shit tons of meat and he got sick, back when he was a witness of jehovah"
"go volunteer or some shit if you wanna help animals"
"ya know"
"and you're not saving animals if thats why you do it"
"it is!"
"It made me so sick. and I read a lot about it later, and there is NO WAY to get proper nutrients without meat or animal product of SOME KIND"
"i agree completely, it's all carbs"

"and then the call center director, BIG IMPORTANT GUY, was like ""josh you want some???"""
"and chris and i got to watch josh look at the gumbo and ask what it is"
"it's what"
"we had GUMBO in the break room because its fat tuesday"
"because barrett just leaves everything for me to take care of a lot"
"hey why?"

there is a gene called eclipse
it is recessive
if you combine to eclipse, you get animals with solid eyes.  but if the animal may be het eclipse, you cant see that because the eye are normal (recessive).  BUT there are tells.  lack of pattern on nose, and lack of pattern on limbs.
So that's how I thought it could work for the genetically predisposed to being gay"

"yea i agree"
haha
"which is a valid strategy"
"but he talks TOO much about her I think, for that ""strategy"""
"both make sense"
"which is my take"
"but Josh could also still be in love with his ex in an unhealthy way and using you as a distraction"
"which makes sense"
"chris says that josh is always whining about his ex so that i can tell him to get over her and stop being miserable, which maybe is him baiting for me to be like ""get over her and move on to me"" or something"

"with this"
"I must interject"
Also
ok
OH
hahaha
"and he saw that way"
"martin dstares at my FB while im at work"
"well i didnt directly tell martin"
"he's weird about that stuff"
"and ignore the fact that you told martin"
"why did he respond like that"
like
haha
"Yeah what you described is weird"
"because he obviously cant convey that to me"
"i just want to know whats going on haha"
"i mean the dude is easily upset by people, but martin is his friend"
"like why would he be upset about the exchange with martin but not the fact that he actually knew? Was he just too caught up in the moment to process that? Or was he flattered?"
haha
explain?
"that's a whole 'nother thing"
hm
"yeah that's odd!!"
"he was super angry at martin"
"He could really be trying to be nice"
"and i honestly thought he'd be pissed at me because martin knew, but he wasnt, at all"
"that's my guess"
"thats very well thought out haha"
"huh well"
"1) It's what you think. Josh is defensive because in some deep internal way, he sees it as a date. The idea of someone calling it that is truly upsetting to him. He's trying to suppress his 'id' impulse to be with you which is causing neurotic anxiety because it contradicts with his superego. He can't handle his feelings.  
2) He respects you enough to where he doesn't want a rumor started because he doesn't want to ruin your relationship. However, he has a low emotional intelligence and doesn't know how to properly respond to that kind of offensive, so he reacts like a child. In a childish way he was defending you."
well
ok
haha
"my bad"
"I was multi tasking"
see
oh
"im trying to analyze why it was such a huge deal that martin made a joke to him about us going on a date"
"but josh told me this"
"i dont care about what martin thinks or says"
"wait wait"
"then he had no reason to do that other than the fact that he is either dramatic/annoying a bad friend. or OPTION B: he is projecting his own ideals onto you in an immature way. He believes you shouldn't be around Josh, but instead of just telling you his opinion, he's acting like a child."
"eh sorta sorta, chris kind of hates martin but they're friendly"
"is martin friends with chris"
"so tell me"
"i heard both martin's and his sides"
"so you analyze it for me"
"that's just having a shit life and enjoying drama"
"oh that's not a real reason"
"martin told me that the reason it was BS for him to come into his dept. making those accusations is because i have a BF that works with me"
"I think"
"it's a good thing to overanalyze"
"paranoia is the human version of prey smelling the predators"
"and no"
"what does chris have to do with this?"
"how is THAT for analyzing? hahaha"
"because his belief is that chris will get angry if people start saying stuff like that, and chris will try to get him fired, which makes no sense, which leaves me to believe the REAL issue is that if chris is pissed, he wont get to talk to me, and he needs me to listen to his bullshit"
"I don't understand the perverse pleasure in that kind of stuff"
"why did he do that?"
"and he kicked him out of his department"
"and josh was like ""GET THAT BULLSHIT THE FUCK OUT OF HERE"""
"oh boy"
"and he was like ""i hear you and hunter have a date"""
"and he went over into josh's department"
"oh martÃ­n?"
"he found out i was having  lunch with josh tomorrow"
"martin is an asshole"
"dude so"
haha
nice
ok
OH
haha

"aka the time I was retarded"
"The time I told him that I had feelings for Josh and he broke up with me."
haha
"And what fuck up was that specifically?"
"but it will get easier and easier"
"I think he just doesn't trust me fully because of my fuck up."
"thatâs how he feels now"
"But I don't think that's true."
"He says he's never really going to be comfortable with it."
"Itâs literally just talking through it until youâre comfortable"
"Iâve conveyed similar things to you in like, the past six months"
"I know I overstate this, but I totally get how chris is feeling"
"It is. Iâve told you that kind of thing before, so you expect it. I care about your and chrisâs relationship, because I like the both of you. That being said, Iâm not worried about you messing it up anyway."
"which i believe to be true"
"i essentially told him that if YOU thought i was going to fuck chris over, you would tell me to cut contact with josh"
"for now at least"
"i think chris and i got it worked out"
"like it doesnât have to be for pleasure"
hahaha

"based on logic"
"Oh so, I figured out the rules on my own instead of people telling me how to act"
"I WAS SHUSHSED"
haha
"I was looking for whether the library rules were inferred or socially constructed from a young age. They WHOLE consensus was they were reinforced from a young age and kind of drilled into everyone's heads. You received negative reinforcement ""SHHH"" for talking in the library, which surprisingly...no one else did"
"What did you find in my responses??"
"I used those questions to look for things other than what the questions asked. It was KIND OF neat"
"You're survey responses really helped me haha."
"I'm writing my SECOND paper n how people act in the library and it's so boring I'd rather be doing literally anything else"
"I respect that."
"If he monitors the messages he already knows everything I have to say. I'm not gonna fight battles/get involved because I'm not taking sides, especially in an argument without sides."
"I'm trying to talk with him, he's monitoring these messages so, you know, feel free to say whatever."
"it's whatever is going to make him upset"
"He's so emotionally involved how he interprets what you say is not correct"
misinterpretation
"which is different"
"when you're really talking about both of you as a whole"
"he thinks you're talking about him behind his back"
"I know this because I used to do that stuff, and I know how it looks on paper"
"I know he obsessively goes through your messages"
"Just in reading that"
"nothing he says is valid"
"He spies on you obviously"
"give me something to write back because im doing nothing wrong"
"Chris Kingery:  
Theres a couple. The male understands that the female has a desire for social interaction. 3:39 PM

The female has negative conversations about her signifigant other behind his back, and has the desire to have more than a friend relationship with the newly introduced male.  3:40 PM 
Once she's caught, she all of a sudden ""has no feelings"" for the new male.  3:40 PM 
Now.  3:40 PM 
This is where it gets complicated.  3:41 PM 
The old male, is of course going to be defensive.  3:41 PM

And I know exactly how that is.  3:33 PM 
Chris Kingery:  
It's not a situation someone should have to handle. 3:33 PM 
And it's really not his fault. 3:34 PM 
Hunter Armstead:  
I feel shitty about making you feel shitty 3:36 PM 
Chris Kingery:  
I dont think you do haha 3:36 PM

Statistically people who earn her degree end up working at kmart or walmart, which you can do WITHOUT college, so If you're going I say make the most of it. She claims to love her psych class, so I've talked about it enough with her to where she wants to take another one next semester, and I'm going to make constant suggestions about how I think it's interesting SORT OF, but it isn't for me; act like I know less than I  do; ask her questions about the class, ect to try and get her to switch to psychology ultimately next year, which is actually a really cool and useful thing to study in college, and it's closely related to what I'm studying"

HAHA
haha
yes!
"build up and then WHAM childsplay"
"I got an excuse from my professor to do interview questions on people I know rather than strangers because of anxiety (yes I know right), and I already sent one to bella, will you answer like six questions about how to behave in a library if I email them to you? haha"

"i no this"
"rickys dope is not mall dope"
"smoke dope"
hahahaha
"Or go to the mall and smoke mall dope with teens"
"it's just the only thing to do here if you dont want to make out in a nasty movie theatre"
"i dont like going places to eat with people because im self conscious about eating"
"I love coffee just not Starbucks. They're fruit drinks are good"
"it makes me sick"
"thats what i got last time we were there, because i hate coffee"
hahaha
"...do they?"
"Haha yes hut they dry your mouth"
"those are rad"
"i dont either but remember the green tea drinks?"
"I dc just not Starbucks"
"im so bad at hosting meetings with people"
haha
"now when you meet josh again, because im about 90% sure he will give in, what would we even go do?"
"thank you for understanding"
Haha
RIGHT
"which i did"
"unless you learned from it"
"i mean, it has no effect on your choice in the ""now"""
"just because you made a dumb choice then"
"You make choices in the now"
"I wish others would understand the concept of ""now""."
"Now is independent of the past"
"It's not"
"but thats not what this is anymore"
"i feel ashamed of my past actions"
"i dont feel guilty about it because i dont have any reason to"
"then i think im doing okay with josh"
"but if youre saying those kind of people should just be friends"
"oh yea haha"
"It still would've ended horribly though hahaha"
yep
"ive always said that shayn and i should have just remained friends"
"Those kinda people are just meant to be friends for some reason I think"
"I guess you're right, I guess I just missed being with someone who would just jam out to the same stuff I do, and would be able to talk about books with me.  But, you're right, we see how that ended."
"I think differences are good"
"No one gets that and if they do its so boring it doesn't last"
"Yea I totally understand.  I did something really stupid last night and I got frustrated with Chris because he doesn't like ANY of my music and he wont read any books and just wants to play video games, and I was just a bitch about it because ""in a perfect world"" my mate would literally only like the things i like.  which would never happen."
"Which isn't bad, I enjoy it. But see where I'm coming from"
"That's awesome. Sometimes it's just helpful to hear someone explain what they see from the outside. You owe me the same in the future,  because things like this will Undoubtedly happen to me. I'm dating my polar opposite, so"
"thanks to you"
"I made a major break through on the way to calm waters today"
"That's why you help me so much"
"That's what therapists family members or good friends are useful for in stressful situations. Haha"
"otherwise i dont know that im seeing it incorrectly"
"i can see it from the outsider perspective if that view is presented to me"
haha
"Not 3 I meant e"
"Oh god"
"NOT IN MY WORLD. But I can see it from an outside perspectiv3"
"You try to rationalize everything. This shouldn't be this way because of X. Some things just are and some emotions just exist without reason"
"Honestly you do what I do"
"I don't believe it"
"and i dont believe thats true, but you never know"
"but to be fair, she went around telling people chris had sex with her in our bed"
"hm i guess that makes sense.  kind of how i hated his ex whenever he would ask her for rides home and then stop texting me for awhile..."
"It's Chris ' s emotion. He doesn't feel it because Josh was mean, or that would be an opinion. He feels it because he loves you and is threatened emotionally by Josh"
"help me understand"
"You're trying go rationalize it"
"That means nothing"
"Josh has always been ridiculously nice to chris"
"But not the hatred"
"I understand his jealousy"
"is hilarious"
"but the way he said it"
"like i totally respect what hes saying"
"isn't it?"
"That's kind of horrendously funny lol"
HAHAHAHA
"""Just the occasional ""He hasnt killed me"" or ""There isnt a penis inside me"" would do."""
"Haha ok"
"omg let me show you this one thing chris said about me not texting him the last time i hung out with josh hahaha"
HAHAHA
"I can't think of anything else I have in common with the guy other than being a sack of shit haha"
"hahahaha you guys are just cramming information down my throat"
"Whether it's good or bad advice anyway doesn't mattwr"
"Josh and I are both incredibly self absorbed and like feeling like the hero. That's why we both spew advice at you.  It's disgusting but it's just something with both share"
"because I care too much"
"I do like being analyzed"
but
"I agree"
Lolol
"We share that awful trait if any"
"Tell me I'm wrong"
"We both feel like we're too smart to be analyzed and therefore we should be the ones doing the analyzing"
haha
"because your eboth insane?"
"Same reason I hate it"
"I know why"
"he haaaaaatesss being analyzed"
"and i had to explain that to him by telling him you analyze people"
"you followed him on tumblr out of no where"
"My advances?"
"He might be weirded out by your advances hahahaha"
hahaha
""" me:  I'm going to take that as a ""sure, if I'm not busy"".  Accurate enough?

"He is abaurd"
"he's just being josh"

hahaha
"hes so ridiculous"
"Okay that was fubby"
"so thats a yes hahaha"
LOL
"""My neutral feeling here is comparatively positive."""
"It's not JUST being introverted"
"Dude when's he gonna realize that the old intellectual type he's trying to emulate is wrong. Old intellectual types love other people, they just thoroughly enjoy alone time haha"

 lordmacbayne:  I said generally"""
"jesus hahaha"
-.-
""" lordmacbayne:  I'm generally against seeing anyone.
Ever"""
"he needs to make up his mind"
hahaha
"in his element, starbucks?"
"where would you want to hang out with josh?"
"waiting for response haha"
"i told him if he doesnt care ill try to arrange something"
"Emo for___"
"Thank you for acknowledge ING that haha"
"emo code language"
hahahaha
"which I believe is a ""sure"""
"he said he is ""neutral"""
hahaha
"which is am aybe"
"he said ""meh"""
"HAHA ok"
"Or soon"
"Okay.  Also I'm having lunch with Josh Monday and I told him when you come into town that if he wants to try a 2nd first impression to let me know haha"
"And i know spoon"
"Okay just remind me tomorrow. I've got a lot to do this evening I'm actually on my phone currently haha"
"12 DAYS!!!!!"
but
"Online may work best for right now"
"Sure. In person when I get back (12 days?) Or online"
"would you maybe want to talk to him?  i told him that youve been helping me with talking to him about issues and that you have both of our best interests' at heart."
"Now I get relationships"
"I had to go to counseling haha"
"But they were there"
"I didn't vocalize any of them"
"Like maybe worse"
Seriously
"I had issues like him"
"AAAND he changed the subject instantly"
Right
"I told him that maybe at some point we should go to couples counseling because he seems like he's guarding his feelings, and i told him that he should try to be less introverted and try to make his own new friends"
"It's up to you. You're being the adult. You aren't being selfish. You know as well as I do that being a social introvert will destroy your relationship. It's so insane for him to only want you and no other friends. He just sounds sad. I thought he would be mature about this. But it's really up to you dude"
"what should i say?"
"Like the whple ""next time"" ""don't fuck up"" get up"
"Don't accept that so easily"
"And that ultimatum is NOT fine. Relationships don't use ultimatums"
"Like he's so insecure it doesn't seem like he is being honest about trust for whatever reason"
"Awesome for you. But he is being a child to the point to where he seems clinically depressed. Like he's super attatched, antisocial, cold. He needs to have other friends. It's great to be with you, but a healthy relationship needs more than that.  You hit the nail on the head there"
"Which is completely fine."
"and then he ended it with ""I don't care. Do what you want to do. Just dont fuck up.

Next time I'm done."""
"because he said he doesnt understand because the only person he wants to be around is me"
"i said ""But I've read time and time again that if you want to make a relationship last, you have to go hang out with your own friends sometimes, away from each otherLike you go with shawnIf I wanted to, I could have been incredibly angry about BOTH strip club incidentsBut I wasntbecause I understand"""
"Okay cool"
"let me try to cop and paste"
"well, pretty good"
"How'd it go"
"Bye bye"
"ill talk to you later, busy bee"
"yea i suppose so"
"The ""never leave you part"" is excessive. Just say ""he likes you as well chris"" or something ya know. Being too kiss ass about it will raise his eyebrow haha"
"""Josh is a good friend, we share a lot of interests, and he gives me good advice.  Good advice about how I should never leave you because you and I are soulmates.  He's on your team, Chris."""
"I gotta go but lemme know how this goes"
"before i hit send, how does this sound?"
"Explain to him about your friendship and why you enjoy it. Without loaded emotional terms. don't get defensive"
"how do i deal with that?"
"""Earning back the trust to hang out with josh, can't happen. I'm sorry for that."""
"he just said"
"i know"
"The more mature you are the more mature he should be in this conversation"
"""I understand that, and it's because you don't trust me.  But I'm trying to earn back your trust because I've been shitty and shifty and self destructive"""
"Just say how you feel about it, without trying to draw lines through what he just said and invalidate it"
"""Hanging out with him alone, I have a serious problem with.""  how do i counter that?"
"What you just did was try to discredit his feeling"
"he says"
"Just say what you think"
"Don't try and patronize him or analyze or break down that his feelings are invalid"
"""If you look at it objectively, josh has never been rude or mean to you.  if anything, hes gone out of his way to be nice."""
"i countered with"
"""Do I dislike him? Strongly. Am I jealous? Of course."""
"""if it's as a friend, I dont care."""
Theb
"Okay good theb"
"i mean hes talking about it"
"The real discussion needs to be in his face and unavoidable"
"He's so closed off"
"im broaching the subject with him now and hes acting like he doesnt care..."
"thank you! lol"
"That was a good example of something to share I think"
"Hahaha god"
"like i told him about the hilarious buzzfeed article i sent to josh describing exactly how depressing he is about his ex"
"But don't agree to end the friendship. That's unfair. Haha"
exactly
"Good then right?  It makes Chris feel more like a part of what's going on"
"ive started doing that actually"
"I dunno think of something haha"
"It's extreme. Make a comprpmise. Agree to talk about Josh to him sometimes maybe so the friendship isn't so closed off and ""fishy"" to hin"
"Is that just him not wanting to compromise?"
"You're right.  One question though.  What if the only thing he will accept is me never talking to him again.  Should I accept that or is that extremeist?"
"so it's not like horrifying and setting you up for failure"
"Under the notion that there are things other than causing harm to josh that will fix this for him"
"and you need to initiate it"
"He's just avoiding having a real discussion about it"
"instead of being so insane about josh like saying he wants to blow hiis car up and things like that"
"actually saying how he feels"
like
"He needs to find a different way to express this"
"Unfair to josh, unfair to you"
"Obviously, he can't do either of those things"
"Chris is just the spitting image of an emotionally repressed male. I know how he's feeling. You just have to trust and get through it"
"if it becomes a big deal, then i will tell you know, the ONLY thing that will make him happy is blowing up josh's car (which he has planned before) or me just never being allowed to talk to him again"
"Which is worse than a big fight"
"for the the sake of chris being honest about his feelings, I almost hope it's a big deal. That way he's at least honest and you can talk it out. He's only been passive aggressive about it before"
"which i dont deserve"
"i just need his trust"
"i mean...i really hope it isnt"
"it may not"
"you have to face that"
"it may HAVE to be a big issue"
"and go with the ""Addressing feelings respectfully"" thing"
"i dont know how to deal with it before it becomes a big issue, and i also dont want to make it a big issue by talking about it"
"I'd give it time to settle"
"Oh yeah"
"and thats an incredible deal"
"so i dont know how to approach the situation with chris"
"I found out later yesterday that water is also included in my rent with the gas.  I just have to be conservative with electricity it seems haha"
"IT IS"
"exactly, thats a fucking ridiculous bill"
"It costs about that to heat my moms entire house"
"that's his responsibility haha"
YEAH
"Yeah that is pretty insane for just heating your downstairs"
"he's going to work on insulating stuff"
"he talked to our landlord today"
damn
"yea chris swore it was amistake and called the gas company, and it's not"
"that's pretty unbelievable"
wow
"My old house used to be like that and our gas was outrageous"
"we only heat our downstairs"
"and heres the kicker"
"Damn it"
"our house is so poorly insulated"
"no our last payment was 168 and we paid that"
"or heavy use?"
"LIke missed payments"
how
"holy god"
"i got a motherfucking 250 dollar gas bill"

"Thank you for being on the same page as me haha"
"in a sense"
"Like he feels left out"
"He's jealous of the emotional connection, like things you might share with josh that you don't share with him"
yep
"Anytime I'm talking to Josh about mundane things, Chris gets pissed. Like, stuff going on in my life or things I'm thinking about."
haha
"Tell me because I think so too"
"I think I know what it is."
wait
"Sometimes he doesn't care, sometimes he does."
"I'm not sure honestly."
"Why can't I talk to him?"
"I mean...he said I could hang out with him Monday"
"I don't understand"
"And totally wasn't being nasty or anything."
"He was like, hey tell josh not to hire this kid named joey because hes annoying"
"He chilled out really fast...like 10 minutes after he threw the phone he's fine."
": ("
"Plus, my best friends live hours away from me."
"I just need someone to talk to.  That's all I need.  Someone to go places and hangout with.  And Chris is perfect for that, and I love him more than anything in the world, but I'm POSITIVE that you know that it's not healthy to only want to spend time with one's partner.  It isolates you."
"Because I'm a creature of habit."
"I'd definitely be in Cross Lanes more."
"If it weren't for Josh keeping me entertained, I'd probably be looking for friends from my past to talk to.  People who get me in trouble."
"If I can't talk to you, I talk to Josh."
"That's the main reason that I get angry."
"It doesn'tbut you need friends, everyone does, and josh is a friend"
Right
"rationalized still. that's not what this is about"
"Thinking of Josh as an actual important part of my life is laughable.  I'm BPD.  All I need is another BPD person to feed off of.  Doesn't have to be josh."
"Also, let me remind you, the only times I've cheated are when the person I was cheating WITH was who I wanted to BE with.  Not just some schmo.  I didn't just cheat and then go back like nothing happened.  I cheated and then told the person I was with, and apologized, and moved on."
"how do you not have your degree?"
hahaha
"I know you. You have a history of, well not cheating and shit, but cheating occasionally and later ""rationalizing it"" then regretting it. I've seen you do it. Your relationship with josh bothers me at times, but the fact that we talk about it often relieves these issues because you aren't romantically attracted to the guy and that's obvious. Chris is experiencing typical guy jealousy. I get it about the most ridiculous shit. Guys are predisposed to think that other men are going to try and ""steal their mate."" That's just how it works. Often, the reactions are off. Now to business...Chris is cool. I like chris. (too much?) Although, chris is a bit childish, which isn't the worst thing in the world, but he needs to face his problems in a more mature way. He seems to exhibit feelings I have about bella talking with another guy or something, but acts on them. The issues is letting his emotions get the upper hand and doing things like throwing a phone. That's absurd. Now to the josh thing that ""almost happened."" that almost happened. You know it did, he knows it did. If it were any other guy, I don't think he'd be AS mad (mad still yet) but josh is a really sensitive area. Give him some time to cope with that. It was devastating to think that after so long you considered someone else. It probably hurt a lot and that's why he's so defensive. In addition, you've matured, and obviously you DID go to him when you had issues. However, like I said, that doesn't mean he has to have the same feeling as you about the situation. He is allowed to feel angry about that. You are allowed to feel angry about him feeling angry about it and acting out. This isn't a right or wrong argument."
"I have proven this.,."
"If I were having issues, I would go to him first."
"i told him how i felt and he flipped shit!  it's not like he caught me doing something."
"does he not remember when all the bullshit went down, it was only because i CONFRONTED HIM ABOUT MY FEELINGS"

"I CANT EVEN HAVE ANY FUCKING FRIENDS"
"i cant tell"
"is that rational?"
"so chris cant stay out of my phone and saw i was talking to josh and literally threw my phone at me"

"i have a complete loss of appetite, do you ever get that?"
michaellll
"But he will never try to make a move, and neither will I."
"Hahaha, yea he's harmless because you have to admit he's smart for not shitting where he eats.  Plus I believe he's pretty jealous of the relationship Chris and I have."
"yeah josh is harmless, he's just emotional wreckage"
"you know this is gonna be a ""thing"" for a while"
"and joseph smith"
"It was only through the power of the mormon jesus"
"Thanks to your insight I think Chris is okay with me being around josh now, which is awesome because I usually catch hell just for talking to him."
"Hahaha Elohim"
"I mean I believe in elohim but"
"I think that's why he hates religion so much. I don't believe in god but I can accept it's existence. It sort of bugs me that he can't haha"
"You hit the nail on the head lolol"
"no nvm, that's completely inappropriate hahaha"
"I'd probably need his consent"
"stay friends with him"
"I want to use him for my thesis"
OMG
"He's overgeneralizing. He had a friend hurt him so he thinks that's how it is, and he probably now takes pleasure in being ""brutally"" honest with others, but he's just displacing his anger about that ""one time or so"" someone said something he knew was true but he didn't want to accept.
also, 
He constantly tries to intellectualize everything. Emotions can never be a factor. Everything has to be rational and he can't accept that we live in an irrational world."
"Analyze that haha"
"But when I told him I have trust issues, he said ""friends don't lie about things that hurt you."""
"Jamee posted it lol"

"what pushes his buttons"
"Like how does he respond to this and that"
"I would interact with him just to objectively observe my own interaction with him. Like I'd think about what I was gonna say and do before I do it."
haha
"thank you for understanding my fascination from a sociological point"
heis!
"He's so interesting"
"it's just like what would possess him to say that and then laught it off"
"It's not like he's mean to you"
"I think what he said about ""being fucking 12"" was kind of cruel, but then he like backed off"
"He's never cruel, but he gets kind of close sometimes.  He lets me call him on it usually."
hahaha
"I've obviously thought about this"
"But in all reality you can't sabotage yourself"
"He thinks that he's sabotaging himself so he gets mad that he can't be closer to you and acts...weird"
"I think he's constantly projecting his fucked of idealism of your relationship on to you by being close, then being distant, then being cruel because he can't deal with the fact that on principle (his own principles that he would never go back on) pursue you"
"I told chris what you said about josh needing my emotional validation, and he totally gets it now"
?
"You know what I think"

"and he just kind of looked at me"
"and not thinking i was like, yea josh likes that place"""
"The other day barrett asked if id ever been to little india"
haahah
"That's what he does"
"that is odd"
HAHAHAHA
"I know him better than my boss does, who has known him for like 10 years?"
"Like we've been talking all day, and I haven't had some kind of autistic social breakdown"
"I just think it's odd that like...."
"I can still talk to people"
"ahahaha thats very true"
hahah
"And I'm just like that"
"I'm normal"
"who claims to be like that"
"but not like Josh"
"I don't like being around others all that much."
"You're the only person I talk to, but that's by choice. My other friends are only good for alcohol."
"you both validate each other in a weird way"
"You are"
"But I guess I'm using him for something similar?"
haha
"which is another red flag"
"I mean he tells me anything I ask"
hahahaha
"No I understand, because I'm using him as well"
"but you'd probably know like who he talks to and things"
"not to say it isn't a real friendship"
"he just likes having your praise"
"you don't have a normal friendship"
like
"Which is odd"
"I mean he doesn't tell me who he talks to, but mostly people just from work haha"
"But I can't really think of others..."
"Probably his ex....maybe his ""michael terranova"", Amber.  She works here, he lived with her and her mom after he had a break up once"
"who else does he talk to in a serious way like he does with you?"
"Right, but he still engages you"
"but he depends on you"
"But he seems distant...which is I'm guessing part of the behavior?"
"maybe not even romantically"
YES
"You think from this that he's emotionally fixated on me?"
"he probably is sad"
"Like that's not emotionally healthy"
"Is he really okay with being so fixated on you?"
but
"because it isn't"
"like it shouldn't at all be a big deal to you"
RIGHT
"I don't mind it, but he should hahaha"
strange
"The fact that I'm one of them is starnge."
"I just realized since you've told me your observations that like...I mean, there really can't be that many people that he talks to daily."
"I'm tempted to read the story now haha"
"but he HAAASSSSS to have something to demonstrate his emotional depth"
"he should be over it now"
like
"I hate when people act like unless pain is severe it's not real. That's not true. Pain no matter the extent sucks. But the fact that he's 36 and complaining to a 20 year old and writing little stories about his long lost love is kind of like...fucked"
"He told his ex to GTFO in a BPD rage, and she did.  Big deal."
hahaha
"It's not like he's been to Iraq or something...REAL"
"and yeah I agree"
haha
"he's just a weird guy"
"He doesn't know real pain"
"I'm just talking about him being so convinced that he's deeper than he is"
haha
"But he's obviously not equipped to be ina  relationship"
haha
"it kind of is"
"I mean I honestly just like the flattery I get from his attention seeking.  It's like a BPD symbiotic relationship haha.  He gets attention, I get someone to talk to."
"it doesn't feel real"
"write about REAL things"
"that's not deep"
"like come on"
"is old enough to have kids to be sad over but is caught up in a teenage-esq romance"
"who by the way"
"He's a SAD, sad adult"
"but That's all I'm saying"
hahahaha
"damn it"
"srsly though"
"""I'll be a great shrink"""
"OMG HAHAHA"
"and he's whining over his ex"
"People have dead kids"
"He needs to get over it"
"because she's been gone for so long"
"like hes having a harder time blaming his behavior on her"
"i think hes maybe having trouble still finding meaning in his ex."
"just like...take care of your stuff and then write something that has meaning?"
haha
right?
hahaha
"I mean..why even write that down?"
"I think he just likes me reading that weirdness."
"It's just sexual"
"nothing primal, or like symbolic"
"it's just a sexual fantasy"
HAHA
"I don't htink it does"
"THINK ABOUT THIS IT HAS MEANING"
"like in that whole thing hes talking about his ex but the last part does not really sound like it..."
"it's just"
"like it's trying so hard there"
"I feel like it's just not deep"
"but i cant"
"and tried to understand the context"
"i read it over a couple of times"
"i dont know"
hm...
*TOGETHER*
"this is so agressive"
OOPS
"like at the very end"
"is he trying to say ""Oh I'm being dominant over you but you agreed"""
"like what is he saying by that"
hahahaha
"""together we can ____ """
"its like sad sad sad sad CUNT"
"it just goes from sad to sadistic"
"this is nasty"
"read the paragraph above it"

"isnt that crazy though?"
"Especially coming from him haha"
"Cunt is not an okay word to say."
"But I could never use ""pussy"" while writing a serious work"
"I will"

"please hahaha"
"just read the last entry"

vapes?
"thats all he cares about"
"The whole lashing out thing, nothing seems to make him happy, being childish and antisocial"
"he has the shortest attention span ever, cant watch more than half a movie with me before hes talking to people on his tablet about fucking VAPES"
"I can kind of identify with it. He sounds depressed."
"he's just become like....i dont know, boring?"
"ive never looked at it that way, it doesnt seem that way...he honestly is very antisocial and doesnt even like going out, any time his friends take him to a strip club he calls me to come get him"
"Yeah what you just said"
"as in ""now that I'm all settled down and committed to being faithful, rather than flirt with other girls to cause fights as I did before, I'll just make it clear that now that I can't, I feel tied down and miserable"""

"but you know what?  ive caught him blatantly flirting with other girls online before"
"and i use that term loosely"
"josh is my fucking FRIEND."
"if he doesnt hear you out, i will scream in his face"
"this week I'll give it a try though"
"which is what I'm woried about"
"yeah, I getcha. The only issue is every time he and I discuss something, I end up having to be on his side for the most part, because he won't hear me out."
"and try to identify with him even if you cant so he doesnt feel like youre attacking him"
"and then explain to him some things that might help"
"and that today say like ""i know that you know shes having an especially bad day"""
"YEah, okay"
"just tell him the kinds of things ive mentioned to you ""over the months"""
"he will liusten to you"
"okay. I've just got to figure out how to engage him without being blame-y or feel like an outsider. He's probably just shut me out."
"im just at my wits end"
"ill go ahead and delete this"
"because he probably hasnt read my shit, hes probably playing games"
"you should talk to him about this"
"That's how he reacts to everything"
"like you're mad about his reaction to you suggesting that he care a little more about things like his appearance. But his responses are the same whether it's about clothes, work, cleaning, anything in your life. He keeps displacing his feelings about your friendship with josh on to everything else. The work thing and the shoes thing have BOTH been about josh"
explain?
"This isn't ABOUT the clothes or the shoes, but his reaction to the clothes and shoes are the BEST EXAMPLE of the dynamic in your relationship"
"I see I see."
"thats how much i want him to care"
"and i went in there and spent my money on fucking shampoo for me, and i bought him a new pair of shoes because they are the EXACT same shoes he already has, except a different color."
"for tj maxx"
"i got a gift card for my bday"
"he would not have the clothes he has if i didnt buy them for him, or if he didnt buy them 5 years ago"
"That's jealousy on a exponential level"
"that's really childish dude"
"no you dont understand"
hm
"I mean I don't care how people dress, I shop at target and gabes, it's just maybe dirty clothes aren't a good thing haha"
"he said i just wanted him to look like fucking josh.  it's so fucking frustrating.  now because i want him to take some pride in his appearance, he thinks i want him to be josh."
"and every time i suggested something that looked good"
"OH ok"
"i kept trying to get him to find dress shoes for the xmas thing"
"just because he dresses like a slob all of the time.  and im sure youve notice that i do too, because who am i trying to impress?  he wears dirty clothes whenever he can."
"Wait what"
"i tried to get him to PICK a pair of shoes that he liked"
"Chris could get his driver's license.."
"i tried the easiest thing"
"What's the first thing that can be done?"
"You can solve things one step at a time."
"i run the business, i work the most hours, i drive the car, i take care of the animals, i clean, i cook"
"There has to be a way to solve that"
"It's pretty obvious you don't."
"Understandable. You need to feel like you're in an adult relationship."
"if he would just try to be an adult, if he would maybe ACT 5 years older than me, i would be a lot less stressed"
"I'm just saying this would be a lot easier if he would have taken that job"
"hes a terror to get out of bed in the morning, kind of like a 15 year old boy"
"I'm not blaming him"
"one his extra day off"
"have to ask him to clean"
"which is not good"
"i mean im a depressed person, i cant blame him for that.  but i like to be spontaneous, im a hard worker, he is too but only when i force him to be"
"this situation could have drmatically improved"
"You're miserable constantly and I just thought it was by chance, but it was actually by someone else's choice."
"I don't know what to tell you. You've probably been as assertive as you could be."
"ive told him all of this"
"none of this is news to him"
"that i try telling him"
"maybe he needs to know some shit that i feel"
"i know but if he cant keep his nose out of my business for 2 god damned seconds"
"that is the issue"
"I just lost a little respect for him"
however
"but I like chris"
"I am"
"this is not good"
"no this is me talking to you.  youre my friend first."
"I care if he reponds to me being upset about this, I think he would know this doesn't change my overall opinion of him, but it's not good."
"like, it should have been obvious to him that i needed something he isnt providing"
"after the josh thing, dont you think he would have tried a LITTLE harder?"
"i dont care"
"Yeah I was thinking that as I typed this"
"im sure chris will read this, i dont give a fuck.  he just gets angry and doesnt actually try to improve the situation."
"In the real world you can't hold a grudge like that"
"it appears"
"Yeah I may not like him much but he's not as immature as chris."
"because hes an adult"
"and i think now you see why i talk to josh"
"no im sure josh has already filled the position"
"he knows that"
"it's not fair"
"you're killing yourself while he acts like a kid"
"If it's still open you bet your ass I'll talk to him"
"he was going to interview him"
"full time"
"josh fucking offered him the job basically"
"i tried"
"tell him that"
"That's a little disappointing"
"are you kidding"
"but he couldnt sink THAT low"
right
"there WAS one open in josh's department"
"because you have to take him"
"there is no full time position in his department that fits my time schedule"
"that is NOT FAIR to you"
"but like"
"no offense"
haha
"dude what the hell"
"yes he works part time"
"or he will also lose his job"
"he works part time?"
"i have to work here"
"im like his god damned mom"
"chris works fucking part time and doesnt fucking drive"
"i would have no where to go"
"i cant leave here"
"like bad timing"
"I'm guessing"
"but it's too inconvenient"
"If there was somewhere else with the job stability that tm provides I would say try to leave"
"im at my desk crying"
"or something"
"or kill people"
"i just want to quit"
damn
"I kind of saw that one coming unfortunately"
"they can fire whoever whenever here"
"HR is a fucking JOKE"
"and he's not allowed to treat you differently for it"
"I mean you can always file a complaint"
"you have an HR department right?"
"essentially im working for free, im doing 3 peoples' jobs and getting paid for one person's"
"the logic is, we are 2 half time employees short and he hasnt hired either of them because why buy the cow?  hunter works for free."
"There is NO logic behind that"
"just because he knows that ""you'll do it"""
"like letting other people leave"
"just because he can"
"not for gain"
"he's taking advantage of you"
"that's bullshit"
"like barrett knows im the bitch and ill always work so he lets everyone else leave"
"i get here at 11, one person is in my department.  as soon as i clock in she fake coughs and says barrett let her leave and she leaves.  so ive been here since 11, SLAMMED with work, cant even put a dent in it, and this just keeps happening to me every day"

"I'm watching the coolest thing"

"So you got it?"
"when i went up front to the lost and found some new hire said that she had picked it up in the parking lot and thought it was hers, even though it had a lock code on it.  it was in her friend's car outside and our secretary had to watch her go get it because i was afraid they were going to speed off with it"

"it's like in the 50's when moms oculdn't be clinically depressed, they just had ""hysteria."" That's literally what they're depicting is a mom"
"Why is it always a sad mom"
"I would love to put all of my ridiculous ideas into a youtube channel. If I only had the means I would be selling Paxil good pill (for sad moms and reptile breeders) everywhere"
pls
"make this real"
hahahaha
"Or....*looks at children playing but feels nothing*...your business just is wanted in the local reptile community?"
"all of the time"
yes
hahaha
"Do you ever feel....*places hand against wall and looks down*....like your reptile collection is inadequate?"
"its a whole thing haha"
"sometimes i get really upset because i think my collection isnt good enough"
"usually i have to manage different business pages and answer questions, i have to go home and pore sex some babies that this kid may want"
lol
"sorry for caps"
"HAHAHA SOMETIMES IT'S AWESWOME, SOMETIMES I HAVE TO DEAL WITH AB UNCH OF PEOPLE I DONT WANT TO"
"(as it courses through your veins)"
"HOW DOES IT FEEL"
Haha
"so im kind of powerful now, it happened over night"
"now that i have that show, i can support or snub any breeder i want"
"because of the show i put on and the experience i have with so many animals"
"someone the other day referred to me as one of the wv reptile elite"
"of world domination"
"its like this huge complicated business plan"
yes
"So it spans out a bit"
acquire
"so the game plan now is to aqcuire females"
"that have such good genes, that i can breed them with any female really"
males
"ive spent over 1k on 4 good breeder malkes"
"you always want to hold back females"
"it's mainly about choosing who to hold back"
"that last part I get"
ok
"I understand basically, but technically I don't understand"
"in two years i will have enough animals to always have some for sale, essentially"
"adding to my breeders for next season"
"which allows me time to keep a bunch back and grow them up"
"but compared to last season, this season im going to have a shit ton of animals"
"and im growing up my leachies and hognoses"
"a female sara"
"something like 8 female leos for several different projects"
"5 gargoyle females, more growing up"
"now we have 8 breeding cresteds, 3 more girls growing up"
"i started with only 3 breeding female cresteds and one female garg"
"this is my first big season coming up"
"oh yea if i sold a lot of these id be rich haha"
"that's right"
"OH yeah"
"Because wouldn't selling ""a lot"" of this kind of thing mean a good chunk of change?"
"yep essentially, this would be caused by shipping temps being bad.  fortunately, people will pay for a gecko and wait until it can be shipped. also, i can do local shows whenever i want."
"Eventually the goal would be ""how much do I need/can I use from what I'm making per week."" Because I feel like sometimes you'd sell a lot, and then maybe go for a short time not selling as much, and the sell a lot"
"i would be making what i do at this job"
"if i could make a measly 300 a week"
"the market here sucks and everyone is poor.  i have a plan for that, which includes continuing to breed lower cost geckos for locals.  in the bigger scheme of things im working on making the big money leopard gecko morphs, as well as hognose morphs.  my gargoyles have great lineage so they will sell well, and im working on a pink garg project as well as the phantom project when ariel's phantoms hatch.  with cresteds, my true love, i will continue to improve upon offspring until they have the biggest heads possible haha, and my saras will cost quite a bit once my female gains about 10 grams so i can breed her.  plus hybrids will go for quite a bit."
"is your goal to develop a bigger market in WV or sell outside of the state? I don't know how large of a demand for specific geckos are in certain areas"
"Which will then be converted into your job"
"which is surprisingly feasible"
"and live off my hobby"
"i dont know, my newest goal is to quit my job January 2016"
"yes those are very cool"
"*wink* hahaha"
"What a badass, cheap, environmentally friendly *wink* house"
"do you ever want to live in one of those sick giant treehouses? I'm reading an article about one in WV that's so awesome."
"makes my skin dry"
"it kind of itches and sometimes like a slight soapy burn haha"
"made up or not"
"I can't tell if that's"
"does it burn you"
"that's unbelievable"
"i shower in it but thats it"
"i mean yea but it's still gross"
"do you have water again"
"that's itneresting"
hahaha
"otherwise he bites her neck and crests really hard and she just ignores it.  now she would bite back lol"
"yes essentially haha"
"she attacks if she isn't jonesing to mate"
wow
"oh god"
"and now shes done ovulating so she will attack him, so we have to wait another month to try again lol"
haahahahah
"and he would like go to mount her and just...stop"
"im trying to hybridize this red crested female i have with my new male chahoua, el bastardo"
haha
"no not that fast"
"ok so not formula one"
"f1 means its out of the wild"
"i have gargs from his bloodlines as well"
"but im not sure"
"but i have geckos from philippe's lines, so i think my chahoua and dal sara may be f1's"
"their habitat is endangered"
"the guys who used to get them fresh from the wild are philippe de vosjoli and allen repashy and frank fast"
why?
"you cant export them really anymore"
"thats how rare they are here"
"yep thats how it works haha"
"I know they're expensive, because I just googled them, and they way people are marketing them is like Ferraris. They aren't listing a price, you basically have to contact the seller before you see the price. haha"
"to experiment"
"i have support to try new things"
"anyways, with ariel by my side"
"and big and mean haha"
"they are sooooper expensive"
"the trachys"
"so it's okay"
"but the 2 species i dont have"
"but you do though"
"its okay, i was waiting for that haha"
"Got 2 catch them all"
"I feel like I have to say this:"
hahaha
"which means i only need 2 more species to have them all"
"so your geckos are like wasps and everyone else's geckos in WV are like the people that own them"
"i have..cresteds, gargs, leachies, chahoua, and saras"
"there are a few of the rhacodactylus geckos on new caledonia, its the only place they live"
"as far as blood lines and just general coolness"
"i have the best in the state, hands down"
"yea dude geckos get expensiiiiiive haha"
"that's a whole lot of pop tarts"
wat
"there can be a $1000 gecko"
"and a 200-300 dollar one for 100"
"then a 600-700 dollars gecko for 300"
"then a 500-1000 dollar gecko for 75"
"theyre like my favorite gecko people.  he sold me a 300-4000 dollar gecko for 50 bucks"
"that's fantastic though"
"crack team there"
"he's a really nice guy though haha"
omg
etc
"drawn on his face with sharpie"
HAHAHA
"theyve given him a reverse mohawk"
"stephanie wasielewski and CJ, some 18 year old kid that they pay to do humiliating things to at shows"
"exactly, if there was an issue with the way he does things, his animals would be dying"
"and define ""his crew"""
"also that's a whole lot"
"""he has hundreds of babies a year"" HUNDREDS"
but
"I know what you mean"
"the last part"
also
damn
"ariel's whole thing is, he's being doing this for 17 years, and it very obviously works for him.  he has hundreds of babies a year."
"and they are open to new ideas"
"but ariel and his crew and a few other people i talk to have opened their eyes"
"yea essentially haha"
"it's the same type that claims you can see satan in the smoke of the world trade center"
"it sounds like people just wanting to pick fights"
"Like I said"
"OH I see where they're coming from, but you're right why would they miss out on the money"
"theyre idiots"
"ive tried to reason with them all"
"they think little breeders will do it.  my counter-argument, no little breeder is going to miss out on that cash.  they would be selling these things for 400 dollars because most small breeders that dont really specialize in anything just want cash"
"That sounds like people just wanting to start something."
"So it would become some kind of massive conspiracy to where experienced breeders who sell hybrids would suddenly stop giving a shit about their animals and their customers, and deceive everyone"
"and then people would breed the hybrids back with cresteds"
"they think people would lie about their hybrids, sell them as shitty looking cresteds (which makes zero sense because hybrids go for 200-400 dollars where as a shitty looking crested would be 50-100 dollars)"
"so it wouldn't lol"
"people who are afraid of it obviously wouldn't let it happen, and you wouldn't let it happen"
"why do people think that would happen"
"which you can do"
"unless you you know, don't let it happen with your hands."
theyre
"their idiots"
"like im going to make chahoua/crested hybrids, but i have to hide them from the world because they all believe that somehow the hybrids will mix back into the crested gene pool and poison it with chahoua blood"
"I can see how that would be annoying lol"
"its fucking annoying"
"everyone else does"
"It's good to question though. I wouldn't follow something blindly unless I knew it was for good reason"
"questioning them"
"ive gotten in disputes with some of the top nation's breeders this way"
"oh definitely, but most of the community is run by a select few people who say something and then everyone believes it to be gospel"
"Hm interesting. I feel like if people knew a lot of what they were REALLY feeding their animals they would be quite bothered"
"not chemists"
"all the other one's people sell are created by hobbyists"
"hes basically the only one that should be allowed to mass market any kind of animal diet"
"which is good I assume"
"that's very specific"
"and ground bugs sometimes"
"i now make mine out of baby food, activia, calcium powder, and Miner All"
"WHAT IS THAT"
"food chemist"
"he uses his food chemist expertiser to make gecko food"
"Ariel's ""kraft"" (what i call it haha) gecko mix has been helping a lot"
"i just want them to keep growing"
"good god"
"i paid 700 for each of mine haha"
haha
"yeah I've learned this"
"you can get them at the cheapest at like 300 dollars"
leachies
"THEYRE SO EXPENSIVE THOUGH"
"and awh, babies"
hahaha
"dude matt wants a leachie so bad haha"
"better, because we're gonna need sooo many grow up tubs for growing babies"
"sweet! haha. better than the humidifier or not?"
"so we returned it and got 70 dollars walmart credit so we bought 3 big gecko tubs, 5 grow up tubs, and a bunch of cereal and junk food haha"
lol
what?!
"and it didnt raise the humidity by even 1 percent"
"so i had to buy a humidifier, a big one, for the gecko room upstairs"
"thank eem (xenu)"
"yesss you are now"
"i smoke flavored tobacco out of a big rotten carrot am i cool"
hahaha
"i pick at my fingernails. IM SOOOOOO AWKWARD LOLLLLLZZZZZZ DIFFERENT"
"then im a lost cause lol"
YES
"what the hell, skin picking is now a mental disorder? hahaha"
"im so crazy help"
"like SKIN PICKING"
"People who do really specific things are apparently sick"
"They've like invented new disorders"
"haha yes"
"that's scary"
"In class the other day they handed out a condensed version of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition"
"im not usually afraid of my hands but i feel your pain.  my heart scares me."
HAHA

"like get them off me"

"There's an episode of 30 rock, where there's a poison leak in the vents, and they all go outside to write the show, and a bum comes up and says ""you should write about how the empire state buildings controlling us all with electricity,"" It makes me laugh so hard"
"say it because i may know it too"
"and it comes to mind when I say ""electricity"""
"and I know what it is"
"There's a certain place I got the whole electricity thing from"
"hahaha thats where the electricity here applies"
"small electri-fee"
"it's a very small fee"
yep
"That reader is so good if you sell enough. At a certain point the fee is like irrelevant."
"AHh i see"
"so ill have to keep track of my price versus his price, and send him back his price.  thats how i make comission"
"since im using my square reader to take cards, all of the money is going into my account"
"yea i need to order a new vape battery, which i will do after monday when I paypal ariel's part of the funds to him"
"I have a high chance anyway"
"that's why I tend to not smoke"
"My family ALWAYS GETS IT"
"Yeah it's very genetic"
"because he sure had a chance to get it"
"i know but the fact that he didnt get cancer means i probably wont get cancer"
"Dude your lungs can still stop working without cancer. haha. it's just...localized to your lungs. lol"
"he's like 80"
"never got cancer though haha, so thats good genes i guess"
"he's still alive, just recovering from his lungs almost giving out from smoking his whole life"
"my uncle fred used to find lizards and snakes and then tell me about them"
"THATS YOUR STORY HAHA"
"I mean, it's in my blood haha"
"I was 3 years old, naked in my back yard, in a creek looking for frogs and salamanders"
"my entire life this is what I was born to do"
"I have so much faith in this business"
"in fact"
ga'dam
damn
"I'm decently well connected haha"
"and he's sending me free super rare project starters when they hatch"
"and i get wholesale deals on his reptiles, that i dont have to pay shipping on, because he's bringing them"
"i mean, im so good at business, that i made an internet connection that is driving from chicago to HERE for ME"
"You've done quite well with it"
"honestly haha"
"which i am, im a business genius"
Yeah
"you just have to be smart about it"
"a lot of people have made it successfully in reptiles"
"I mean ideally, I will have this business running so well that in 3-4 years I will no longer have to work at this job"
lol
"I want to have a kid before I'm 30. I don't ever want to be an old dad."
"getting your shit straight with your reptile business and all else fist is probably good. I mean you're 20."
haha
yeah
"theyre dirty people haha"
"i dont want chris' parents near it either"
"and they would have hgad to watch it while i went to work"
"RIGHT right"
"i dont want any of my parents influencing my child"
"but childcare would have been the biggest thing"
"yea i agree.  i mean honestly if i really really wanted to i could have made it work"
"That's just me"
"Yeah it's really about weighing the KIDS life out. I think 23 is a good age to start having kids if you have everything together, maybe later"
"but then i thought about health insurance and welfare and food stamps and i didnt want my kid to have a shitty life"
"at first i wanted to keep it"
"and it was positive, and i just started crying"
"but then when we stopped, i got super emotional, crying at work every day, i was super sensitive everywhere and just tired all the time, so i decided to take another test"
"i just remember when i wanted it, i would pee on a stick and be upset when it wasnt positive"
"but you have to way it against everything else that you're saved from"
"It does come with a certain degree of guilt"
"It's not yours until you claim it as yours. But I can see how the whole thing would be traumatic"
"You didn't kill your child"
"I'm sorry"
"And awh lol"
"I support a woman's right to choose in any circumstance. You shouldn't feel guilty about it because you weren't ready for a kid. It was up to you."
"i cried a lot yesterday"
"and it made me kind of regret killing my child"
"i just am deciding to tell you this because yesterday some girl was saying women who abort their babies feel like murderers about it, even though they dont tell other people that"
Why?
"i was afraid you'd judge me"
insensitive
sorry
LAST..
"Thank you for confiding in me"
"now you do, and chris and josh"
"no one knows"
"i paid to have an abortion at 7 weeks in"
yes
"oh really?"
"though I wasn't gonna not supprot you"

"im not in the community"

"i really dont care haha"
"you know if you do, and someone buys one, they're going to name it sonic and you're just gonna have to be ok with it"

" I couldn't deal with that. Id be so upset as I bought hog after hog."
"so I'm going to hopefully breed mine if our coworker decides to buy the male albino instead of the one she has picked out now"

"dude im so nerv ous about this show"

"i saw that but didnt read it"
"it really is"
"Oh well yeah"
haha
"dude did you see that horribly sad buzz feed story about the girl who died of cancer and like, tweeted everything until the moment she died. Or can you still not access buzzfeed?"
"worst time to not have klonopins ever haha"
"im stressing so hard over this show"
"yes i do"
haha
"you know what I mean"
"I feel off."
"thats quite odd haha"
"I'm having the weirdest day. Today I was 6 inches from the brain of a dead human. I sat there smelling the formaldehyde-y smell like it was some kind of women's fragrance until I snapped out of it. I think something is definitely not alright with me lately"
"nah not too much, they stack"
"It seems the tubs are going to be more of an issue than anything right? you'll have to reorganize stuff"
"Damn straight lol"
"I've got geckos coming out of my ears haha, I should be good on my current and up-and-coming breeders for a little while.  I'm going to have that whole leo wall stacked to the ceiling with tubs, I'll need a step ladder to deal with them.  Well, that's more Chris' project haha"
"and yeah you wouldn't really need to right"
"Whoa that's a good bit"
"I'm not buying geckos this season, just upgrading our facilities"
"So I'll need that many tiny stacking tubs haha"
"I will have 4 females laying, in leos, so thats probably a good 30-40 babies"
"Let me try to calculate leopard geckos, which grow MUCH faster than cresteds..."
"well god damn"
"That's JUST ONE species that I have"
"If not more."
"i have 8 females that will breed.  That could mean 80 babies."
"I just hold everything back until a certain point when there's geckos coming out of my ears, offer them online and do reptile shows"
WOO
"But dude next year I'm going to actually make money doing this"
haha
"OH ok"
"The ones he's sending me are currently incubating in eggs lol"
"I'll have 4 females laying"
"What about those one rare one's that your friend was going to provide that he just discovered basically?"
"and gargoyles"
"and hold back all my awesome cresteds until theyre larger before i pick and choose who to sell, who to keep"
"im going to be steadily producing high end leopard geckos"
"dude i am so excited for this season of my business"
haha
haha
"i love their skin"
consistency
"Is it weird that I want to have their skin. Not in a poacher type of way, I just want to have a pillow or something os similar consistensy"
ok
yeahhhhh
"Look at these ones, parents of the tiny one"
haha
"but I believe you"
"I have a hard time with colors"
"look at their purple spots"
purple?
""
"like, these two are the parents of my larger leachie.  theyre purple!"
"That sounds like a neat project"
"so ive been bored at work recently and decided to start doing this thing where im tracking the lineage of my geckos and then putting their parent info and photos on a google document.  i found out some crazy cool stuff."
"YEah I wouldn't lol"
"yea im not drinking it haha"
"becauseI my mom lives close to downtown her's was one of the first to come on, and she said she's still not gonna use it for a while because it doesn't smell right"
ew
"ours had a yellowish tint to it"
"i dunno"
"it was water allegedly?"
"I saw a photo of what looked like a tub filled with urine."
"the water is still bad"
haha
"wait what"
"nope it wasnt haha"
"As long as you flush your pipes"
"I figured that was a rumor"

"matts super stoked for that"
"yeah good point"

"i think im going to save my klonopin for the reptile show, im kinda nervous haha"
hm
"So a week"
wednesday
"when is your next refill?"
"but yeah good point"
"I took them for sleep for a while. They help with that."
"but I should be detoxing because I used to take a few extra for bed sometimes. '"
"took a single one today"
"i decided, fuck it, if im gonna detox im gonna detox, and i went all yesterday without any klonopin and i was fine"
"hi fran"
hello
"thats what im trying to do =["
" I dunno. I dont want to tell you one way or the other. Just get by."
"and i could just buy enough to last me a couple of days"
"i dont want to order etizolam, but i know someone who may sell it here "
"Since when does : / translate to that"
:/
"Yeah this is rough"
"and im fucked"
"but now it looks like i do need the pills"
"i should, but i thought, i have so many and my appointment is really soon, i need money, and i dont need all these pills"
"And yeah you cant do that because you SHOULD have enough tehcnically"
"The likelihood of that is VERY LOW"
"and i cant tell them i dont have enough or theyll take them from me"
"i just dont want to have a seizure"
"the bottle says no refill until the 23rd"
"Also I cant believe you dont get a refill at your appt"
"Did you just run short?  I can see how taking care of so many animals would run you"
"yes it is...im going to see if i can find any more around because i have 4, which i can cut to 8, but then i still need a couple days more"
" Yes but Less miserable. I've had to deal with about your number before. Trust me. The act of taking the pill helps a lot. 8 days of it is Better than 4"
"so even if i cut them down i am still going to be miserable"
"""The withdrawal method that most doctors recommend is for patients to wean down from the benzodiazepine that they are taking. Sometimes doctors will switch from one benzodiazepine to a longer acting one such as Klonopin, to try to make this process easier. Doctors will usually try to get their patients to wean down by about 10% per week. This means the detox may be able to be completed in about 10 weeks. Unfortunately this slow taper is almost never successful. The withdrawal symptoms are just so strong that most patients are unable to tolerate them. Most patients suffer with severe anxiety, increased insomnia and panic attacks. They feel so bad that usually they go back up on their dose. Success rates of tapering benzodiazepines are very low, probably less than 20%."""
"But when I get low and no refills, I cut them in half and Mark sure I'm really careful"
"Ration them. Turn that into 8 and dont smoke because that's not enough to keep you calm. Also DONT SELL PILLS if your body withdrawals you'll want to literally die. It sucks so much"
"i have 4 left and im terrified im going to die"
"dude im in deep shit, i dont have enough klonopin to last me until my refill because i thought they would refill me today on my doctors appointment but i have to wait a week and a half and i had been selling extras to help feed animals"
" Haha I didn't know that! I wanna look for it."
"yea it was on buzzfeed haha"
"It's ridiculous"
"It's made national news at this point I think"
"seriously no one has a clue about what this will even do"
"yea I guess you're right"
HAHA

"I've made this point before"
haha
"she does"
Yeah
"she gives maria control"
"no, your mom is weaker than you lol"
"my mom would pity her because my mom is a better person than me"
"why would she end up back at home?  she's not special"
"it sucks because now there isn't hope for her to improve"
"she'll just end up back at home"
"if we commit her now"
"and even so"
"and my mom said she's no longer going to care for her at that point"
"she turns 18 this year"
but
"If my mom had the guts to do it a year ago it would have been perfect"
"here's the dilemma "
"its so obvious"
"i dont know why she hasnt done that already"
"dude i know right"
"i would have her comitted"
haha
WOOSH
"VENT VENT VENT"
"(she can't cash it herself because she doesn't have a bank account)"
"my mom takes half her pay check anyway for things she's stolen"
"so my mom kind of wants her out"
"when she is home it's hell"
like
"and she's fucking destructive "
"also my sister is way bigger than my mom so that's out"
"and they don't take us seriously enough"
"it's illegal to run away in WV"
"We have"
"if she leaves the house, call the cops"
dude
HA
"tell her she cant leave the house until she pays (when she gets paid)"
"your mom has control over her"
"shes a child"
"if maria would agree to something without physical attack, which she would win anyway"
"That would be an awesome solution"
"maria can pay it herself because she has a job"
"heres how you solve that"
"My mom is already broke"
why
"HE'S GOT STACKS"
"he like took her to court today apparently "
"my mom has to pay my dad 200 a month until maria moves out due to a loophole in their decade old divorce agreement"

"AUDIT THEM. THE IRS. THE INTERNAL REPTILE SERVICE. INTERNAL AFFAIRS WILL GET THEM."
"I want someone to inquire about the bloodlines of their german giants lol"
"I WANT TO STAB THEM ALL INTO TINY PIECES "
"They tell everyone theyve been breeding for 6 years but in actuality they have OWNED reptiles for 6 years"
"That's annoying to me. Haha"
"THE GRAMMAR IS SO BAD"
"""come by and grab yourself a reptile that dont suck"""
Irony
"and when they advertise animals for sale, they say"
"theyre fucking called REPTILES THAT DONT SUCK"
like
"yes it is, my competition are total scumbags"
"Thats actually a sc umbag move haha"
"oh yeah?"
"Yeah, but they really dont give a rats ass"
"well these people know these arent giants, they just sell them as that for extra cash
"
"ah i see, he wants them to know what theyre talking about."
"Hes too kind. You know this. His messing with them is just then product of him being smarter and VERY thorough. He doesn't find humor in it like we do. He just gets frustrated haha"
"he may find it funny to mess with them, and if he does, tell him that haha"
"German giants are a hybrid species developed with a dragon species that is no longer legal to export from australia, and even if they arent true german giants, if youre selling a dragon as a ""giant"" it should grow to be around 25 inches long, and the parents (which they have display at their pet store"" are not."
"if he really wants to fuck with him, give him this information"
exactly
yes
"So its like selling muts that look like terriers as terrier basically?"
"because they are normals being sold as literally a hybrid species of dragon"
"That would be pretty funny"
"also, if he has the balls like you said he does, he should tell the people at Reptiles That Don't Suck that their bearded dragons are normals and not german giants"
"Awesome, I'm excited for him to be able to come to a place where everyone isnt retarded"
" Yes definitely "
"i can bring my camera and take photos and send them to people"
"do you think matt would want to get a picture with some of the animals?"
"thanks to ariel of course"
"I will have probably 100"
"they will have one table with priobably 20 animals"
"i am going to CRUSH them at this show"
"yep, and now when those fuckers who talk shit about me at their pet stop see me from now on, theyll back the fuck off"
"Yeah thats probably the most satisfactory part of it then"
"the respect i will have in the community after this will be priceless "
"You win"
"it's the fact that 3 different ""seasoned breeders"" have tried and failed miserably to host a good show in WV, and theyre all grown men who chastise me for being young haha"
"Just networking and attention to the event right"
"has NOTHING to do with money"
"and the very very best thing about it"
"dude we're gonna blow this thing out of the water"
"I actually remember her haha. And awesome awesome awesome"
"and we're sending it to all of them lol"

"I could probably get a small hand out from chris' parents but then id have to pay it back, and my next check isnt until the day before the reptile show, and ive committed to pay around 500 dollars that day"
"yeah understandably "
"god damn"
"I'm just freaking out"
"so i have 3 things to buy and 69 dollars.  i need to pay my 40 dollars phone bill, I need about 30 in gas, and also we need more food.  I can't buy all of that.  Also my water filter just stopped working so I need a new one and can't afford bottled water."
"You were actually talking about that two weeks ago"
"Oh yeah"

jigaboo went outside and it's inside me help down the street. On the sidewalk, he saw a(n) big ole wet cock. âGulp!â Down went the wet cock. âNot bad!â said jigaboo.

Next, jigaboo headed for the park. There he found a pair of you're a grand old flag you're a high flying flag ass ASS TITTTTSSSSS just sitting on a bench. âGulp!

âthere's a spider in my shoulder ! It must be time to go home,â said jigaboo. He ate back home and up the stairs to his ATHLETIC bed.

"If we didn't work together he would probably have sex with me and that's it, and I don't even want that."

"I have sundays and mondays off and they can only see me on mondays and I always end up wasting my mondays at doctors' offices"
"I just don't have the time to see a therapist."

"but i thought these josh feelings had gone away"
"i mean yea the geckos represented a chance to capture free animals that i sometimes pay 500 or so dollars for"
"I would still be shaken up over the dream"
"Why would the geckos be there? They represent something else unique that you can't have"
"But think about this"
"Well that dream was intense that's no surprise"
"But I woke up and still have these feelings left over"
"They always bother me a lot though"
"I believe"
"It's pretty meaningless"
"I think its common to dream about those things"
"Its literally everything that you've ever even slightly wanted that you can't have"
"  I've had dreams like that"
"which is frustrating"
"i have never had a sexual dream before, i only have dreams where i fall in love"

"And I left and went to this strange creek"
"And he went with her"
"and it hurt me deeply"
"and he went with her"
"Well it started with me screaming at shayn to not go with ashley because i knew she would ruin whatever of his life he had left"
"  Okay have at it"
"I had a really emotional dream last night and youre the only person i can talk it out with"

"Apple Surprise

NIPPLES , THERE'S A ROACH ON MY COCKâWhat was supposed to be a routine apple-picking trip turned into something much more. PRAISE SHINOUTO UNTIL YOUR EYES CREAM and (SAY 8 NINE TIMES AND ON THE NINTH TIME JUST GO AHHT) went to FUCKED AND LEFT FOR DEAD's farm to pick apples. This was a funny sort of farm! To get to the orchard, they rode on a(n) GIRAFFE HUNTS BEAST, LION EATS GIRAFFE GROPES TIT SCREAMS IN VICTORY driven by A LITTLE GIRL WITH NO EYES, EARS, OR TITS, BUT A GIANT PAIR OF GLASSES! PRAISE SHINOUTO UNTIL YOUR EYES CREAM and (SAY 8 NINE TIMES AND ON THE NINTH TIME JUST GO AHHT) went about picking their apples, and they filled two big bags with the most PUT HOOKS IN MY BLADDER AND TURN ME INTO A BROKEN URINE KEG apples they had ever seen.

Suddenly, SELFIES WITH GENGHIS KAHN happened to ride by on a(n) I FUCKED MISS MCALLISTER!!! and offered to turn the apples into a delicious pie, right there in the orchard. PRAISE SHINOUTO UNTIL YOUR EYES CREAM and (SAY 8 NINE TIMES AND ON THE NINTH TIME JUST GO AHHT) didn't believe that this was possible, but they agreed. SELFIES WITH GENGHIS KAHN told them to close their eyes, and before they knew it, the apples were steaming, hot apple pies. PRAISE SHINOUTO UNTIL YOUR EYES CREAM and (SAY 8 NINE TIMES AND ON THE NINTH TIME JUST GO AHHT) couldn't believe their eyes! They were so amazed, they ran home and called DONATE NOW TO FRIENDS FUND FUCK FLIGHT IN FEAR FROTH. When FUCKED AND LEFT FOR DEAD was contacted about this matter, a reporter was informed that this âmiracleâ was âjust a really EROTIC CINEMA practical jokeâ!"

"A Special Valentine

It's fun to let people know you care about them by making them valentines for Valentine's Day. Follow these instructions to make your own GOD IS DEAD valentine:

To make the valentine, you will need pieces of THE INSIDE OF MY BUUUUUUUTTTTTTTT paper and pieces of AN OLD CURMUDGEON WITH A BIG DICK paper. You will also need scissors, some ARE YOU READY FOR SOME MEAT BALLS, and a marker or a(n) A BABY DEAR TAKES MY EAR, I FUCK HIS ASS.
Cut the THE INSIDE OF MY BUUUUUUUTTTTTTTT paper into the shape of a(n) PART YOUR HAIR DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU LOOK LIKE *THE VIRGIN (ERUPTS) MARRRYYYYYYY*.
Cut a smaller PART YOUR HAIR DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU LOOK LIKE *THE VIRGIN (ERUPTS) MARRRYYYYYYY* shape from the AN OLD CURMUDGEON WITH A BIG DICK paper.
Glue the AN OLD CURMUDGEON WITH A BIG DICK paper PART YOUR HAIR DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU LOOK LIKE *THE VIRGIN (ERUPTS) MARRRYYYYYYY* onto the center of the THE INSIDE OF MY BUUUUUUUTTTTTTTT paper PART YOUR HAIR DOWN THE MIDDLE YOU LOOK LIKE *THE VIRGIN (ERUPTS) MARRRYYYYYYY*.
Use the marker or the A BABY DEAR TAKES MY EAR, I FUCK HIS ASS to write a Valentine's Day message to the person. If you don't know what to write, try a phrase such as, âWon't you be my AUTOMOISTEN Valentine?â or âMICHAEL thinks you are as SPEED RACER WAS BETTER THAN YOU WILL EVER BE as SHOW ME YOUR FRESH TITS ASSHOLE!â
You may wish to add other decorations, such as HANK WILLIAMS JR NOW NOW NOW SAUUUULLLL FROM BREAKING BAD or other paper shapes. Now you have the perfect GOD IS DEAD valentine to give to someone special!

Feeling a bit confused, he wandered around until he saw a sign that said âZoo.â It smelled like his friends, so he decided to Fucked a bunch of black women in. He found a section called Beavers with hot cock bad sand, and they seemed to be very friendly animals, so he made himself right at home. The zookeepers discovered him, and they were happy to see him.

Super Salad

To make the best Anus salad, you need fresh ingredients. The best time to buy a fresh Anus is from July to Hot cakes. Go to your local market. Pick up one Anus and study it. The Anus should be Fresh and Wet. These taste the best! Put 15 hands of them in your shopping cart. You will also need a pound each of carrots and Alien greys.

Next, you need to get the ingredients for the salad dressing. You might like pussy dressing, which tastes yummy on Anus salad, but you might also enjoy steve dressing. Pick out the tool belt best fruits you can find. Take your ingredients home, and get ready to make your salad.

Wash and dry each Anus thoroughly. Use your The movie ""Pulp Fiction"" to separate the parts of the Anus. Put the pieces in a large salad bowl. Next, chop the carrots and Alien greys, and put those in the bowl. To make the dressing, mash the fruit in another bowl. Add a cup of oil and Hen taste teaspoons of vinegar. Pour the dressing into the large salad bowl and mix the ingredients. VoilÃ ! Enjoy your Anus salad."

"He embezzled money. Fraud. Sold giant homes on useless lake front property in the middle of nowhere. Claims to work for the government, which leads me and my entire family to belive he's schizophrenic. (and some other weird things)"
"lawyer, doctor?"
"i dont even remember what he DID"
"whats your dad doing nowadays?"
"i suppose it does"
hahaha
lolol
"tells you what kind of person he is"

"I also know him"
"I do"
"i dont get into politics"
haha
"but it is"
"fuck joe manchin though"
"That is for west virginia"
"which is a biggish deal i guess"
"she apparently did make up on joe mansion last week for something on ABC"
"that makes sense"
"oh ok I see "
interesting
"she gets all the info on local films and stuff because she does make up for them"
"Oh ok"
"mom sent it to him"
"Where did he find this? lol"

"yea he's trying out for the narrator part"
"wait what"
"wiat what"
"he'll definitely get it, he has a weather man voice"
"chris is auditioning for a voice acting job on a documentary about coal mining"
"Enter, my life.  My own daily doom.  Here I sit, in a cubicle, on my couch, on the floor.  Always, always-always, looking at things I donât like, but donât have the energy or will power to make better.  Those clothes in the floor?  Theyâre clean, they shouldnât be on the floor.  But Iâm not going to fold them.  So I guess theyâll stay there.  Besides, I mopped the floor about a week ago.  Or so.  Maybe it was last month.  âDust canât accumulate that quickly anywaysâ, I lie to myself.  I think thereâs a cluster of blood clots in my lungs.  Thrombi, if you will.
  Pulmonary embolism, come at me.  I canât do anything about you, Iâm yours to take.  Or just make me wait and worry.  Whatever.
"
"heres some more"
"Thank you"
"I lvoe it"
"That describes how I feel most of the time"
"
	âThe end is neigh.â  Well, it always is.  It has been for hundreds of years.  Why make such a statement when the end is always staring you right in the face, daring you to say something about it.  Thereâs always this apocalypse, that apocalypse; this earthquake, that meteor.  What we fail to realize, while we are still living, is that the end of the world is as simple as a blood clot.  Not looking both ways before you cross the street.  The mid-sized sedan rapture.  You see, the entire world, everything you can see and touch and wish for, is all in your mind.  Itâs in my mind.  Itâs even in his mind.  The entire world is a figment of electrical impulses in a fat organ filled with water and blood, tucked neatly inside the human skull.  A bullet could be your apocalypse.  
	I live a daily impending doom.  My heart hurts, thereâs got to be a tumor in my head.  That guy looked at me funny from across the road, heâs going to shoot me as Iâm walking the opposite direction.  When you realize that you are always about to die, it can free you immensely.  On the other hand, it can take a devastating toll on the human psyche.

"This is what he said was so good."
"its all depressing because i write when im depressed lol"
alrighty
"let me send you the paragraph, im proud of it"
wow
"that's flattering"
"so it was a pretty nice compliment"
"which says a lot because this dude reads EVERYTHING"
"and he says he really likes my phrasing and whatnot, he compared one of my paragraphs to something from his favorite book"
"yea he convinced me to start writing"
"that's a good release"
"when i get really upset i write"
"really now?"
"i started writing a little bit"
"nah it's just some obscure material"
"like it wasn't real"
"I always thought it was a fluke or something"
"he sent that to me"
haha
YES
"it was like a 20 minute song of smashing pumpkin samples"
"remember the song pistachio medley?"
"me too"
lol
"my old hard drive crashed"
"I lost all of my music"
"it was a looot of music"
"so now i have that lol"
"Whoa "
"he sent me like every smashing pumpkins song that has ever existed"
"yeah sounds like it"
"And yea he's good for small talk"
"Well he is just straight forward and I took what he said out of context. He apologized for coming off that way. "
"I think small talk is just probably much easier with him"
"He doesn't sound bad at all"
"Wait I thought you stopped being friends with him? or am I confused??"
"like, even more so than managers or even call center bosses"
"his hair is amazing and he dresses like he gives a fuck, he is probably the most job-oriented person in all of ticketmaster"
"he loves the smiths, the pumpkins, velvet underground, etc"
"we like pretty much the exact same music"
"we talk about shoes and stuff, send each other links to cool clothes"
"we share a lot of things in common, and just as many things not so much"
haha
"but I couldn't deal with that kind of friend"
"he sounds really insecure if he's so set on making you believe what he believes. "
"I'm certain he's not"
"but he's not a BAD person"
"you know you probably would, he can be very frustrating"
"I would hate this guy"
"like they've STUDIED enough about it to PROVE it wrong with their SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE"
""""
"he was a jehovahs witness and was thrown out of the church."
"to try and ""prove something?"
"all atheists do that shit"
"of course he does"
"he does sound like atypical athiest, but he studies religion."
ATHEISTS
haha
"Yeah it sounds sour"
"Anyone can do that. The satisfaction comes in knowing that you're right and not having to prove it to people who won't follow you. Trying to shove things down peoples' throats makes you seem like you don't know anything at all, and also like a typical atheist"
"It seems like he was once at least semi happy"
"he's had a very sour life"
"It's like, you can't be offended by anythign he says"
"that is the wrong kind of person to be"
See
*im
"to tell me why i wrong lol"
"He will send me studies and links to stuff, etc"
"well it's kind of both.  you see, he LOVES to argue, even if he doesnt believe what hes arguing.  he has literally told me this.  he is a very straight up person.  But when he argues abotu something and he actually believes himself, he can present pretty strong evidence for his opinion.  "
haha
"that's the vibe I get"
"did he ever have any valid points or was he just stuck so far up his own ass that you couldn't understand him?"
haha
"Essentially he would say ""That is bullshit"" and then explain for about an hour why I'm wrong."
"I'VE READ WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES "
"I'M RIGHT"
"just freak out and say NONE OF ITS TRUE SHUT UP SHUT UP"
"What would josh do"
"and until then I can't believe that they do"
Right
"you have to have one to know they exist"
"you sound like josh but not like an asshole haha"
"unless of course I have one"
" I don't think there's such a thing as a cathartic, enlightening event "
"in general"
"but "
"Not like a whole religion thing"
"My issue is I don't believe there is such a thing as a spiritual experience "
"did the exact same amount"
"chris had no spiritual experience"
"travis strom, friend and coworker, shroom veteran, says that shrooms will show you the parts of yourself that you are ready to see"
"yeah exactly "
w
"I'm trying to follo"
"i know what you mean, it's hard to explain to someone"
lol
"I guess I'd need to do them to understand"
"but I honestly don't"
"I know what you're getting at"
"it felt like i had found the balance id been missing"
"See "
"I saw a part of my ego, represented as a person and a color scheme, that said to me ""power"". i cannot really explain it.   didnt ""see"" it in the outer world, it popped into my head and it made my perspective change. "
"like specifically in other words"
haha
"what do you mean see your ego?"
"I don't see the world like that unfortunately. I see where you're coming from, but I don't believe that there's this ""whole new way"" of looking at things. I'm as pessimistic, judgmental ass and I don't like things that can't be easily broken down for me."
"it didnt feel awesome at all"
"im not saying it ""changed my chemistry"", it allowed me to see my ego"
"I bet it feels awesome"
"It mimics serotonin "
"It just seemed to open parts of my mind that i had never been able to see before"
"that i gained a lot from, and i dont feel a need to do it again"
"it was a spiritual experience"
"it wasnt ""fun"""
"no euphoria"
"it didnt make me feel good like most drugs"
"i didnt even ""trip"", i wouldnt call it a trip"
lol
"and fast"
"I did on salvia, but that was kind of scary"
lol
"is people who have done it like it a lot and say that it does help. Of course it does it changed your brain chemistry in a way that your brain isn't used to. That's awesome and everything, but it's like I'm fine with the way my brain works and I don't want to feel temporarily fixed by a psychedelic drug. It's just, I don't see a need to do it, and I don't enjoy tripping really"
"when usually i would feel helpless"
"i was able to see that i have power over things"
"with emotional problems, mental problems"
"Like what I'm saying"
"with what? "
"i feel like it helped me"
"it can help you, it has helped a lot of people"
lol
"I'm not scared of the trip really, It's just I like my brain chemically balanced. I'm happy with it like that. I just don't want that ""new perspective on life."" It's cool to hear about, but I don't see a need for it"
"ive heard that even on high doses it's not"
"It can be though"
"the ""trip"" itself is not in any way scary"
"but it scared me pretty badly for awhile"
"I just remember like breathing soooo deep and feeling like not enough oxygen was getting to my brain, i took an aspirin and drank some water, elevated my head, and i was able to sleep"
"THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AFRIN IN THE WORLD FOR ME AS IT FUCKING IS"
haha
"Oh wow"
"it was the one psychadelic that chris and i had always considered doing.  it was kind of rough because i had eaten so they made me nauseous and gave me a headache.  As soon as you pee though, all the chemicals flush out and it pretty much stops within 15 minutes or so.  It still made me feel weird, I was up until 5 AM because it makes your nose clog up and I felt like I was deprived of oxygen.  Chris loved it though, strangely enough.  He wants to do more lol."
erg
"experience "
"I enjoy hearing about the expierience though"
"I don't want to"
"that's a lie"
no
"I just "
"I wish I could do it"
"Thats insane"
"i dont know, i feel like i dont ever need to do it again, i gained the knowledge i needed."
"I saw a female figure in my mind, in a dark red and purple gown, and it was like my mind was a huge palace room with red and purple billowing satin lining the walls, and I feel like my perspective shifted to this place.  I think she represented some sort of ""power"" aspect to my psyche.  Another theory is that since I am a libra and my problems come from me being unbalanced, she could be the missing part of me that balances out my mind."
"In what way?"
"that happens"
"but I feel like I discovered a hidden aspect of my mind/personality"
"I was fully aware of everything and whatnot, didn't forget anything"
"Not enough to hallucinate"
"i did shrooms the other night"
lol
"A whole lotta nothin"
"hey "
"so what's going on mai brotherr"
"i had to take like 4 photos to get the whole thing, it wraps around my elbow and stuff"

"all of them are"
"Team is also a good song"
"It's good"
"her music is my new favorite"

"It's like one of those cut up clips to make it look scary"
"okay hold on lemme make sure theres no supes watching me lol"
"This is literally the funniest thing I've seen all week. It's old, but I am dying"
"and then i left"
"on a lighter note"
"and he kissed my on the top of my head"
"yeah exactly"
"thats sad"
"yea i mean...when i man known for only wanting sex requests for you to just cuddle him"
"that's the most upsetting thing I've ever imagined"
God
"hes a sad, lost person"
"and he asked me to cuddle with him, and i did.  and it wasnt anything sexual, i could feel him just wanting to be loved."
"and he was so sad about how little ashley cared about him"
"and ive told chris about this"
"there was one point where i was hanging out with him"
"he fucking shot himself in the arm"
"yea i mean"
"bad wording"
lol
"nothing specifically"
"just that he has STDs, is partying more than he used to which is saying a lot, and is in very bad shape as a human being"
"what have you heard that i havent? lol"
yeah
so
"most likely "
yeah
"I understand why he would say that"
"he hopes he dies"
"I mean"
"i know what he really means is"
well
what
Whoa
"even when he recently told me he hopes i burn in a fire"
"I've heard things about him"
"i mean he lost his soul completely"
"I didn't wanan say that"
yeah
"now that he has herpes i see him killing himself"
"which is bad for him"
"Yeah but he's only gonna be around people like HIM"
"to keep him alive"
"but he NEEDS someone like me"
"because i cant be witht hat type of person"
"i think about it sometimes and cry"
"its very sad"
"that's almost sad"
"when we would hang out a few months ago, he would tell me how much he hated ashley and he would tell me how much fun he had with me"
"he even told martin that"
yes
"he loved me"
"I think he had a brief streak of honesty with you"
"i still tot his day dont think he cheated on me"
"i forced myself to trust him"
"i remember when i was with shayn and he went to allgood"
well
LOL
"You're conniving  "
"Why would I trust her to camp out for three days with dudes at a ""Music"" festival"
"and call her at random times"
however
"I know all of her friends from charleston. I've hung out with them. They're all idiots so I don't distrust them. They're just a bunch of burnouts who pretend they grew up in the 60's"
"told you haha"
"good idea"
yeah
"Well like"
Hm
"see if anythings sketchy"
"you should face timeh er at random times"
"does she have face time?"
"you are smarter than that"
hahaha
"I'm smarter than that"
no
"SHES THAT GOOD"
unless
"I couldn't think of anyone she would be flirting with or anyone"
"It's just "
"I guess that makes sense"
"but hm"
"haha. whoa "
"so, his allegiance is with me lol"
"see when chris would change his password it was because he was flirting.  as soon as he got away from those sissonville mutants he completely changed.  and then when this josh thing happened, he pretty much threatened to kill himself if i left him."
wait
"probably for the better haha"
"she changed all her passwords"
"I felt like I was going to though"
lol
"I never found anything"
"I did this for over two years"
"he flirted sometimes"
"but he was sketchy back then"
"i mean i did it to chris too"
"that's insane person bahavior "
"It took me months to stop secretly going through her emails and social networking profiles"
"See, I have before"
"or just ask her point blank"
"well i dunno if you have a hunch i wouldinvestigate"
hahaha
Yeah
lolol
"She was a whore"
"I know, I was the same way"
"I was just naive "
"i told you should was a whore, you never listened to me lol"
"Even fucking nicole sangid cheated on me at age like 14 what the fuck man. lolololol"
"and by get drunk I don't mean just get drunk"
"I've never been in a relationship where the girl didn't get drunk with someone else. Other than Angel. lolol"
"I just don't trust people easily"
"so he was telling the truth"
"it wouldn't make sense"
"Yeah like why would he tell her a lie about that"
"i didnt believe it until he told Moriah about it, she lives in florida and vapes and keeps geckos and they talk pretty often.  "
"but weirder things have happened"
"Yeah I wouldn't have belived that story"
interesting
"which i think is partially true."
"but he told her the same story he told me and i believe him. and she told him that the reason i started getting into josh was probably trust issues from me not believeing him."
"well gary would abandon him at the shop and she would take him home to gary's, she would take him to petsmart to get bugs for his reptiles, he had no ride ever so that makes sense kind of. but once i saw a hickey on his neck.  and he wouldnt talk about it forever and then finally explained that they had all had a dumb wrestling match and tiffiny held him down and bit his neck to piss me off. i did not believe this until recently, when the whole josh thing happened chris was talking to a female reptile friend and he told her the same story he told me about tiffiny.  at this point he could have said he had cheated with her if he really had, because he had just broken up with me over josh."
"What lead you to believe that? and how did you find out it wasn't true"
"and i had no way to really know"
"i understand your feeling completely, its how i thought when i thought chris was still fucking tiffiny"
"sorry im freaking out. I've never had the chance to vocalize this and I'm having a random thing"
"but you can hide a small thing"
"she would be pushing me away"
"nothing serious"
"or flings with other people"
"or more than once"
that
yes
"I'm just thinking, like"
"but if she had sex with someone like once, then she is probably just trying to keep that secret"
"I'm not saying she ""found"" someone else"
"hm...if she had found another guy, she probably would be pushing you away slowly"
"but haha whatever right"
"That sounds insane"
"I feel like that she's lying so well that the lies unraveling would upset her, but as long as I don't know she's fine"
"That's what I think"
"i just automatically think that these new pseudo-hippies will pretty much get down with anybody, but i dont know her so i cant say"
"Yeah she isn't anymore. Daisy and devon are pretty shitty "
"I don't know like, I wouldn't trust devon woodrum, and theyre like best friends.  and she was friends with daisy, which i think is insane as far as bad character judgement."
"she's confessed to liking other guys while we were together. I could barely deal with that much"
"I mean"
"I know her other friends at home"
and
"She has one friend at college, who doesn't even smoke or anything."
"what kind of crowd does she hang out with
?"
"i do know what youre talking about"
"You know that feeling, like you know that you should be concerned about someone or something in any sense. I just can't pinpoint it"
"It's just"
right
"i dont know her well enough to say either way"
"That's what I'm saying"
but
"well i dont want to tell you youre crazy because instincts are often accurate"
"really now"
"I just want to believe so bad she's hiding something"
"Well I remember when she was with that nasty thing zach pauley or whatever, he TALKED to jenny hogan, and bella like went nuts and started crying and shit"
"and I'm not the jealous type"
"like anything involving another guy"
"but I sometimes get that ""woah somethings up"" feeling in my stomach over really small things, like at random times."
"I just want someone to tell me I'm crazy"
"I don't know"
See
"Does she have a history of cheating, flirting, being shady?"
Paranoia?
"Why after three years and no evidence of ANY reason not to, I am constantly struggling to trust bella. Like I don't know specifically why or what, but I basically can't and I feel like saying I do is just lying to myself"
yesh
"can I ask you a question"
"the eggs for her will hatch probably this week"
"by the time the two others get here, i will have sub adult phantoms that ive bred myself"
EXACTLY
"that's ridiculous. plus the two others coming"
"holy shit"
"and now i know theyre worth like 2k"
"we were going to sell them for 40 dollars"
"which is hilarious because"
"waiting for their babies"
so
yep
"the first one is distinctly super"
"they look like this"
"our other two are normal phantoms"
"thats the super phantom, the super form of the gene"
woah
black
look
"i showed ariel the photos of their eyes"
"also that means you are actually a couple steps ahead of your self now haha"
"How can you be certain?"
"as adults."
"i somehow already have 3 of them. philippe de vosjoli accidently sold 3 babies a long time ago, and i ended up buying them."
"oh wanna hear something crazy? remeber those geckos i was telling you about"
"it truly is"
"It's fantastic"
"through the"
"gets me throught he day"
"i love buzzfeed"
hahaha
lol
"I didn't take many of the questions seriously"
"come to think of it"
"I think for one of the questions that I really had no answer for I said that people think that we are lesbians"
"probably gay"
"gale is oprah's ""best friend"""
"who the fuck is gale"
HAHA
"""oprah and gale"""
"I got"
"the first ten times"
"See I just got that"
"tine fey and amy poehler"
"and I don't even want to tell you what came up"
"I've done it twice"
"I just did it"
"did you do it"
"oh my god"
"tell me who we get"
http://www.buzzfeed.com/tanyachen/what-famous-celebrity-friendship-are-you-and-your-bff
"do this"
"Haha yea! You're my only friend, and I appreciate that a lot."
"like everyone does: you think they're cool at first and then they turn out to be a huge child"
"That's why I stopped talking to him. If he can't control himself that's not my problem. It's just annoying the way he acts."
"Maybe you shouldn't be around him either. Sounds like a high risk situation. No one really wins, just sounds stressful"
"No the context is different. The last time we went on a walk it lead up to Chris breaking up with me for like 5 seconds and then he got on my gchat and told josh, as me, that I'm attracted to him. So I don't think josh wants to slip up around me. I'm pretty sure he'd go in for the kill if I didn't work with him. "
"I dunno, I'm very busy"
"which basically means ""no, never, fuck off"""
"and he said ""dont know. im very busy"""
"i finally asked if maybe sometime he'd want to go for a walk again"
"it just got so obvious that he doesnt really care about anything i say"
"i stopped talking to josh"
"I know what you're trying to say"
"i mean besides you and chris"
"i just...dont even know what to do with myself because i cant tell anyone who would care haha"
"i know man"
"That's fucking insane"
"but awesome aesome awesome dude"
"but weak analogy "
"it is "
omg
"it's like the opposite of that simple plan song"
"im just a normal person, i dont know how this happened"
"This dude just handed me a career out of kindness.  I have to figure out how to pay this forward."
"And of course eventually the money will go down as their value decreases, but im going to invest this money in a nice car, a house, and my 2k dollar hognose project that will also make me thousands of dollars"
"I could probably get 10k out of the bigger guys"
therefor
"will not have what i have"
"with thousands of geckos, that make TONS of money"
"the BIG TIME breeders"
"Especially because, like, well...think about this"
"Gecko people will pay out the ass to one up a rival."
"I mean, that's what Ariel paid.  And he specifically told me to sell them for as much as I can."
"A shit ton"
woah
"I'll be making"
"good to know though!!"
"If I sell them at base price 2k a piece"
hahah
"I mean profit wise"
*months
"Oh and they lay for about 8 month if not more."
"Well, they lay 2 eggs every30-60 days.  I have around...give or take 6 or 7 female gargoyles.  The others may be male, don't know yet.  So, it's a co-dom trait which means about half of the babies will have this eye morph."
"Like how much do oyu estimate you'll be generating?"
"I told him after I sell the first one I breed, I'll have money to fly down and thank him in person."
"I will be able to buy a house because of him."
"Well, I'm a parto f his FB group for lovers and breeders of these geckos, and he works for Kraft foods.  Very rich, is a nutritionist with patents and whatnot.  Loves geckos so he has the money to buy these amazing things.  I ordered some gargoyles off of him, and he sent me a free female crested of high value for my birthday.  And I guess just because he sees me as nice and not in it for the money, he chose me as worthy of this."
"I'm very happy for you. How do you know this guy? Like how do YOU know him PERSONALLY? That's a big deal"
"IM GOING TO FINALLY BE ABLE TO QUIT MY JOB AND RAISE LIZARDS"
"IM GOING TO MAKE SO MUCH MONEY"
YES
"He's sending YOU two of them?!"
"let me tell you about the most exciting thing to ever happen in my whole life  
it's a long story so buckle in 
So, Philippe De Vosjoli.  One of the founding fathers of rhacs in the trade today.  He is revered the same way Allen Repashy is. 4:13 PM 
Philippe has finally isolated a gene in gargoyle geckos, and it is co-dominant.  It's called ""phantom"", and it makes their eyes black.   
My good friend Ariel Cudia in Illinois is friends with Philippe, so Philippe let him buy some of these gargoyles that only he has.  Ariel still have to pay 2k for each one. 
Ariel is going to breed them to some normal gargs and because the trait is co-dom, more than half of the babies will also be phantom.  
Out of these babies, he is going to raise them up, and release FIVE to people around the US that he trusts to keep this on the way DL.   
He has decided to send me TWO OF THEM, for free.  
I told me I have to charge as much as I can for them so that they don't explode into the pet trade and they retain their value.

"is there anyone else you can talk to about this? who can really give their two cents?"
just
"i really want a kid"
"not a vice"
"That's now a real reason to have one"
" but that's using the child as a vice for youself"
"for this beautiful baby"
"will ENSURE that i cant relapse, get with anyone else, kill myself, etc because ill have to give up my selfishness"
"having a kid"
and
"i want to risk it"
"it may be selfish but"
"go for it"
"If you wanna take the risk and you've considered all"
"especially down the road"
"That it's SO hard to show someone in your position that kind of evidence "

"but here's the problem"
" I understand that"
"so the baby is healthy"
"and make better choices for myself"

"at this age"
"I know"
"chris saved me"
"but chris"

"i know and im just realizing this"
"I'll always love you like a sister, but you have to know that your behavior sometimes upsets me. Over the years I've watched you do things that I wish I could stop. You're in a place in your life that's good enough to come to terms with this though"
"They are really effective if you come to terms with it"
"The treatments available are therapy, med management, and psychotherapy "
"i see...you cant really treat the cause when the damage is already done"
"It's kind of a state of mind"
"Which are often anxiety, manic depression, ect"
"There is only medical treatment for the symptoms "
"I do"
"My mom and John think it's the worst"
"its like the worst mental illness short of what yourbrother experiences"
"that's a serious thing"
"yea i understand"
"ya know"
"but I'm not a fucking doctor so why would I say that  to you"

"You've had it since we were like 16"

"I got completely wasted last night, so I'm recovering."
Maybe
"would you be drinking or no? im gonna go to the coin star and get some red bulls for jager bombs but id need more cash if you wanna drink too"
"alrighty =]"

"does ticketmaster do transfers? I was thinking about this. Your life has been exponentially difficult here, with one thing after another after another. Would it be viable to move to another town and have a fresh start before you start having a family? like REALLY start your life. Without patronizing friends and family, steady access to drugs (in the situation that that's even a problem anymore) and difficult coworkers "
"be direct haha"
"go for it"

"If you wanna focus on work"
"but I can't read your mind"
"I feel like it might be impulsive"
god
"that's big"
woah
"but a baby"
"it's because you're better than community college and you know it. They treat everyone like that. If you wanna go, you know you need to go somewhere real and not try to do everything at once."

"the whole time my boss is telling me he cant work with my school shedule"
"Want me to be honest"
"couldnt get anyone to help me"

"That's what I thought "
"Just being careful"
"he has"
"Maybe he's been in that kinda situation before "
"Honestly it sounds like no biggie"
"Affect is good to "
"But surely effect his job, then his mind,  and finally his body "
"It will slowly"
"Sounds like a pair of scandals made to wear to conflict of interest beach. "
"and ive told him the same"
"that if it effects his job hes said himself hes done"
"but he knows"
"he did MAYBE hit on me a couple of times via chat"

"Scandal "
"im a rep"
"hes a supe"
"well hes made it ABUNDANTLY clear that if gossip or anything starts around the workplace, we're done being friends"
"Or both"

"Sounds like he thinks he can like slowly become friends with you  then go from there type deal"
"keep in mind, this is the first time we hung out"
"that sound platonic?"
"as a dude"

"didnt hit on me even once"
"and offered to buy me stuff at the peanut shoppe"

"but theres missing pieces"
"like, ive almost got him pegged"
"i cant read him"
"i dont know"
"but in a good way?"
"he is very very odd"
"and he came in on his day off to do something and talked to me for like half an hour"
"he FINALLY met me yesterday, hes always in his cubicle so i see him like ocne every 2 months"

"2 miles there, 2 miles back"
"I know I was just saying that it's a far walk haha"
"i was so close =["
"i just hope i didnt ruin a potential new friendship"
"either way"
"i know where you live =P i think josh lives very near you"
"Yes. I live on the far edge of the east end. Its a fun walk."
"would you be able to fill in if he wont talk to me?"
"either way, i want to walk from the east end to the mall on monday, even if he wont go with me"
"Does not sound like its a big deal honestly"
"and im just upset that i may have lost a friend in one sentence"
"so i dont see what the problem is"
"he wouldnt freak out wheni mention my boyfriend may not approve"
"if he had any interest in me at all"
"i mean"
"going on a walk downtown jesus"
"I honestly don't know what I think haha"
"he ""doesnt need the drama at work"" even though i just talked to chris and he said he doesnt care"
"I dunno "
"he freaked out and now i think ive alienated myself completely from a potential new friend which i never can find"
"but as soon as i mentioned that chris may or may not approve"

"i have the effexor sitting on my desk and i want to try it again...but i remember in the hospital telling myself to never try it again because of how terrible i felt"
haha
"It's humiliating and makes me feel weak"
"You think I feel good about myself scarfing down cereal bowls full of meds in front of people"
"me too"
"that would be fantastic"
"i would love to not need any medication"
"i just want to be normal"
"i know that"
"I'm ont endorsing anything specific"
"thats general"
However
"do what you have to do"
Okay
"you have to trust that when i get these im only going to use them when needed and when i get help ill get rid of them.  its gotten to the point where im crying at work everyday.  its going to cost me my job."
"but I have to be able to trust you to keep cool for like a day"
"I can"
"i appreciate you trying to get me into good care"
"thats all that can help"
"other than get you real help"
"I just don't know how to personally help"
"You're fine"
"i know im sorry =/"
"I can't say much more"
"I dunno"
"Just be patient"
"which makes sense"
"and OCD recently"
"they just treat me for depression every time"
"they dont even pay attention"
"i know all this, i keep telling them this..."
"but it could be psychosomatic "
"You definitely are"
"I really think your a severe hypochondriac. Like wanting to self medicate and everything. That doesn't mean you aren't feeling it though"
"its so scary"
"i keep thinking im having a stroke...i imagine that my face is going numb, and i have to repeatedly bite my lips to make sure its not"
"Do what you feel like doing"
"I'm just gonna leave you to your business "
"and not need to order again"
"i can sell them all and make like 3 times the money when i get help"
"Don't resort to that again"
"You can do this"
"but do you really wanna be the person who orders canadian benzos?"
"I understand that"
"I'll have an answer by tomorrow"
"its not a waste, im miserable"
"If they're expensive anyway"
"save it for real care"
"Then don't waste the money"
"id like to be able to get a doctor to help me"
"okay well let me know what you find out.  i think ill place a small order now but i hate ordering them, theyre expensive and a waste of money if i can get actual help"
"I'll figure something out"
"Definitely Blue Cross, but I have to check into the other one"
"not many people accept health smart"
"john acccepts those I think"
"they wanted me to pay 40 dollars at process strategies until i told them i have united behavioral health on my blue cross"
"i cant afford copays so i have to be able to use both =/"
"blue cross and healthsmart"
"What insurance do you have?"
okay
"let's see what my mom says"
"at least"
now
"Don't order them"
"if i order these, i can use them until i can manage to find a good doctor. i dont smoke anymore and benzos are out of your system in a couple of days"
"not in a ""mean"" way but I'm really tired of this conversation. This needs resolved, and it can be"
"i mean"
okay
"I'm texting my mom really quick"
"there aren't a lot of good ones"
"but you know"
"The right doctor will form a game plan based off of that"
"im sure it says on my medical files that im an addict, my mom has told all my doctors"
plus
"shes my main problem, if i dont include her in the issue then im lying to them"
"that can be an issue"
"when you're young parents can talk"
"explanation for everything"
"Answer: your mom problems has told them something. Like that you're a liar, ect ect. This new guy, isn't a good care provider and that's a known fact"
"dude...ive been going to psychs for 15 years...its so incredibly stressful for me to explain myself to 5-6-7 doctors repeatedly.  the last one ridiculed me.  none of them think im telling the truth."
btw
"online reading is dangerous"
"and give you respect"
"a GOOD doctor can help you"
"and if you can just lay off "
"You did"
"she won't quit smoking so they'll always treat her like shit"
BUT
"My girlfriend needs them so badly."
false
"theyll keep giving me anti-depressants and blood pressure meds"
"and everyone keeps telling me because im young they will never give me benzos"
"i keep reading online that they wont"
god
" A real psychiatrist could help you with that"
"it got so much worse when i moved out and she resents me for it"
"i know my mom is doing it"
"ive never felt fear like this"
"its like no one can help me, i feel completely alone and i think im going to die every day"
"i dont know michael"
"yea im sure"
"they want you to be bleeding out"
"Internal medicine will do that"
"they told me i was fine and discharged me"
"What happened when you went"
"im tired of going to the ER and looking like an idiot"
stop
but
"i know its not a real fix"
"I can't condone self medication like that but I can't really stop you if you want to do that."
"thats why im going to give them to chris so i cant abuse them. i know they help me not feel like im dying, but if i take too much i turn into a stupid snarky bitch, and thats really bad for my business"
it
"My mom and I talked about"
"I may be able to get you in with John Hutton"
"because i hate your damn doctor"
"This is rough"

"and the meds they gave me gave me a panic attack"
"You're withdrawing from the benzos"
"but yes i went"
"im going again on the 8th"
"don't do that"
"Did you go to the doctor"
"im absolutely miserable"
"so im thinking abot ordering more of those foreign benzos and giving them to chris to distribute to me as needed. i keep thinking im having a heart attack. like 5-6 times a day. or a stroke."
"I forgot"
HAHA
"lyea its so bad...justin timberlakes lowest career point"
"I hate it so much"
"I've seen it so many times"
"I have it"
"god that's shit"
"except the love guru"

"I remember it lasting 20 minutes"
"It's kind funny haha"
"I dunno he keeps coming back and acting weird. like picking up stuff as if he's about to leave then not leaving. Like sitting in a chair and getting on his laptop with a cello on his shoulder"
"falling into walls and shit?"
"thats awesome! haha"
"Pretty swell. My roommate has been doing salvia every night, so there's that. Hahaha."
"how NY going?"

"cream mixed with fudge sugar free pudding"
"i made a no carb thing just now"

"Hows that going lately?"
"Oh neat."
"just finished taking care of geckos"
"heya brutthuh"
"What's up?"
"hey dude"
"im going to have to go to the ER again.  my left arm feels weird"
"he made an off hand remark about my weight, twice"
"im remembering more and more completely uncalled for things that he said now"
"Yeah tell them that he wasn't respectful and yoh want someone else"
"what the fuck"
"im pissed"
"wow hes a PA"
"its bernard grose i think"
...what?
"He's not a real psychiatrist. I looked him up on health grades"
"when i was trying to explain how i feel bad for my mom and when she calls me it can ruin my day, he said ""block her number"""
"total asshole"
"he made fun of my accent, and then when i tried to describe the process of my racing thoughts, he was like ""if its racing thoughts, just say that"""
Reason
"I believe you that he's mean. That's good enough"
"why does she thinks hes sketchy?"
okay
"Yes. Say you aren't comfortable with him."
"can i do that?"
"Request another physician. Dont say why. "
"its giving me chest pain"
"but this does not"
"i dont know what else works"
"i onyl know what makes me feel less scared"
"he was kind of mean to me"
"i need help"
"My mom said he was sketchy"
Omg
"Do you want help? Or a certain kind of drug?  Be honest"
"No offense: That's just the addict in you talking. "
"and i dont want to go to the ER again, last time they treated me like an idiot"
"i know if i had a xanax i would be fine"
"chest pains now"
"hm i dunno then =/"
"Just small stuff"
"Or anything. "
"Not from clonadine. "
"good plan.  have you had effects like this? be honest"
"Call in the morning when you can though"
"hopefully the effects subside soon"
"I've had them and the they pass"
"ill wait it out"
"You have to call someone. I don't know what's going on with you. So idk. Ah. At worst call a hospital/emergency number. But I just think its an initkal reaction to the pill. "
"pharmacy and doctor are closed"
"Good. You need to if it's bad"
"im gonna go out and call"
"If anything call the pharmacy where you got the prescription"
"im seeing when they close"
"Call after work. I know you think it's nothing if you don't wanna call"
"im at work, i cant"
"Call process strategies if you are concerned "
"I take that pill dude."
"i dont know"
"maybe ill try the meds without the blood pressure meds"
"apparently other people experience this with clonadine and it just gets worse for a lot of them"
"Then call the offices and make a deal.of it. If you think it's really serious that's what you need to do"
"i can feel it"
"my skin really is cold though"
"No. You've psyched yourself out. Why does the dr. Have to be an asshole and the medicine have to be wrong? I think this cold stuff is psychosomatic "
meds
"does your skin ever get cold and kind of tingly when you take the blood pressurem eds?"
"i dont think talking to him will help me, hes kind of an asshole and probably thinks im ajunkie or something"
"Do it. Youre bugging out a little"
"i cant even see him again until im off work.  ill call tomorrow. i dont have his number or anything"
"Call your doctor. Iyou've osychef yourselfnout"
"can't take this medicine, i feel icy, my limbs feel icy, my throat is tight, its scary"
"you should come over sometime if you get the chance"
"its fine =P"
"but we'll talk later dude"
haha
"Hey so I have to go now-sorry to cut you off"
"and he would NOT leave"
"chris was a foot from him]"
"like speaking his name, he wouldnt act like he heard either of us"
"he literally ignored us"
"when we asked him to turn the volume down"
SHOCKER
...
"for hours"
"he made us watch animal sex on youtube"
"hes fucking insane"
dude
lol
"Well danny is danny"
"but when someone else brings it over i do"
"It ALWAYS feels pressured"
"chris still does, but i dont feel pressure at all when he does"
"It's social pressure"
"but I don't wanna feel like I have to"
"I don't care who does it"
"I see it like this"
"Or at least have him respect your policy "
"i try to keep him out of my house at all costs"
"i dont like him anyways"
"dammit danny"
"when someone rolls a blunt its a social activity"
"It's just how psychiatric medicine works"
"i was so pissed because if it werent for danny collins i would be clean"
yep
haha
"You know all of this"
"He can start to trust you more."
"thats why i didnt question it"
"but if yo ueventually test negative..."
"yea i know"
"No they can't if yo utest positive"
"Then you can begin to develop trust with him."
"but doctors dont believe that haha"
"Everyone over there is hella good."
yep
(poooooot)
"But did you tell him that you recently quit smoking?"
haha
"Dude, you are quite compulsive."
"most drugs reduce libido "
"don't worry about that and it won't happen"
"like the celexa did to me"
"im worried that ill become unable to have sex though"
"thanks man, i am happy i was finally able to get in somewhere after months of trying"
"Things will get easier along the way"
"and do exactly as the doc says."
"I am for you."
"Just be happy that you're finally getting help"
"Meds are often used for their off label purposes"
"You never do"
"from personal experience "
but
"and you feel like you know what you need"
"Sometimes they don't make sense"
"i try to be as much as pssible"
"and TRUST him"
"just make sure you are specific to your doc."
"thanks, i need some reassurance to keep taking these haha"
"You'll switch on and off diffferent ones"
"and I finally feel better"
"I've been trialing a med for weeks now"
"but it's worth it"
"It's a long process"
"It's all about finding the right combo of meds to stabilize your brain chemistry"
"but dude just don't stress"
haha
"by people in morgantown"
"I get teased for it all the time"
"I do too"
HAHA
"he made fun of the way i talk, apparently i have an ohio accent"
"yea the guy was dr grose"
"then working your way around"
"It's all about starting off on something"
"effexor can raise blood pressure but i have pills for that haha"
"They wouldn't prescribe anything that kills you"
"i looked up the pills but i didnt see anything bad"
hahaha
"Just don't look anything up."
"You have those. I can be objective. You have those. lol"
"if they see fit they will prescribe more or change the dose"
"huh....effexor is for OCD tendencies he said"
"I promise the docs there are good"
"then you get used to it"
"I get weird ones"
"It's probably the initial reaction"
"You're overthinking it"
"They know what they're doing. Just chill out. After they're certai nyou don't do any kind of drugs anymore they will fool around with your prescriptions. Blood pressure meds are GOOD"
"its making my throat feel funny"
"I'm on blood pressure meds"
"just chill for a scond"
Dude
"he gave me effexor and some blood pressure medicine -.-"
"the doctor was kind of a douchebag"
"yep...they drug tested me...im guessing i tested positive for weed even though i quit smoking a couple fo weeks ago"
"oh yah?"
"went to the doctor"
"yea...i dont even know what to believe any more"
"but that guy is a government official"
"because I've heard all of that from insane people on the internet"
"He started to sound insane"
"its scary"
"yea dude"

"just have him read several care sheets and take the info that is on all of them and use that"
"haha what a precious little soul"
"he's not stupid, but he's naive. He thinks everyone is smart, and nice."
"matt trusts the internet too easily"
"just screen shotted that"
"and the substrate needs changed when its slightly dirty because frogs get bacterial infections easily"
"and they can get impacted easily, so dont feed them on their substrate"
"dont leave stuff like that in with them"
"if they dont eat it, try again later"
"could be lol, get some tongs and dangle their food in front of them"
"interesting "

"I'll never forget when I was little..."
"because fuck crickets"
"meal worms for leos and skinks"
"i hate em just for every reason haha.  we never buy crickets.  we breed dubia roaches and i get about a thousand super worms from my buddy in ohio"
"They're just too...move-y"
but
"i hate crickets lol"
"I know they aren't"
lol
"but the large ones seem so aware"
"I'm fine with the small ones"
"I hate feeding anything the large crickets "
"i have to buy a live mouse, then kill it, then she'll eat it"
"my blood python is so weird"
"Yeah understandable "
"we need some to fatten up our breeder leos and for our fat tail and hitler.  i just dont like feeding vertabrates"
"Is that bad?"
"i guess we're gonna start breeding feeder mice =/"
"they're communal, females can live together usually, and the can live with one male"
"Can they live with one another? Or are they solitary creatures"
"so of course im selling it for super cheap lol"
"we've got a little crested for sale, trying to sell it to buy mom something for her birthday"

"decided to start breeding leos"
"i got 7 new lizards in the last 2 days"

"He's actually quite organized with his reptiles now. He's so meticulously clean it's annoying"
"they have some nice started ones at inland reef"
"Tree frogs but he wants the pacman ones"

"Like birthday cake vs wedding cake"
Haha
"Different words for the same thing. Its like S.A.D. bipolar, and rapid cycling, or long waves.  Manic depression describes the disorder. Your manic, then depressed, repeat "
"I guess I could see a small bit of bipolar disorder in your but it seems more like manic depression, but theyre very similar"
"But they're very meticulous about brain chemicals. Treatment takes a while.  I jujust had to totally start over. I found out that my biggest issue is bipolar disorder. Shocker right  "
"Good thing I'm terrible at drinking anyways haha"
"Then you can have a beer if you want. "
"Then you're stable you know"
"But yeah the less you drink/smoke yada yada yada especially in tbe beginning the better. You can clearly and quickly see if your treatment works. If they find one that does faster it'll be easier and you can just keep at it"
"they taste so bad and cost so much.  right now im vaping monster/seet tarts/ cotton candy/ menthol haha"
Off*
"Not cigs. Youre weening of cigs anyway"
"I mean narcotics lol"
"and i use lower nicotene"
"ive actually started vaping again"

"it's great"
"I think you and Chris have a really solid foundation"
"You were just too frequently underestimated by your own family"
"but you also aren't some boring office junky"
"Yeah you aren't stupid"
"I was skeptical at first, and then I realized how shitty life can be and that you have to make your own passages to get where you want. "
"I mean, I just want to do what I need to do.  I want to keep breeding reptiles and sell them, but until we have enough of them to make a substantial profit off of, I need this job and I'd like to get some sort of degree"
"i really appreciate that =]"
"Seriously, f*** everyone that judged you for dropping out. Some people's lives just play out differently than others. And you're doing well at your current job"
"I'm so proud of you. It takes real maturity to hold down a job and do all of that"

"I KNOW YOU KNOW HIM"
"hold on"

"Sorry we didn't get to hangout saturday. my mom left and went somewhere and I was home alone .-."
"that sounds terrible"

"didnt depict it like that. i was only in a pet shop for like 3 hours lol"
"oh god it's mtv"
"Everyone here is rich and from new jersey and has an IQ of like 50 "

"I would've but I don't know where you live and I didn't know you wantwd me to "
"wish you would have come over yesterday, took a sick day because of work anxiety. slept for about 16 hours."

"but im not revered as the ultimate driver haha"
EXACTLY
"the struggle"
"oh damn"
"yea haha and i had a dragon and two frogs in the back so i had to roll the window up and crank up the heat"
"my face but i must drive"
"what the hell"
ahh
"It's like"
"I've had to do that"
"and i had to hold my head out my window to see the road"
"yea like it was hailing, raining, and snowing all at once."
"that sounds awful haha"
"Oh god"
"so glad im home"
"almost got hit by trucks"
"turned a 2 hour trip at 70 mph into a 4 hour trip at 25-40 mph"
"wipers stopped working"
"just got back from motown"

"just sitting here. watching house with my dog."
"hey man, whats up?"
"i have to go to morgantown tomorrow.  irony."
"waddap broseph"
"okee dokee seeya"
"Spring break. And yep. I need a break. I'm going to my appointment right now so I have to talk to you later haha "
"is it like easter break or something?"
excited?
Yes
"coming into charleston today?"
"yep it is.  i just want a legal amount of legal drugs and some counseling"
"I just want you to get past this. its sucky"
yeah
"and i really dont want to sell it"
"and people want to buy the stuff im getting."
"i dont do it either.  im just saying from my personal experiences."
"I've always had bad experience looking up side effects. If I see what they are I always experience them. So I refrain from that haha "
"our country wont regulate it because the tolerance is so easy to get.  it kind of sucks.  but its better than any benzo ive tried here. xanax put me to sleep and klonopin makes me forget EVERYTHING.  this just has smaller side effects i suppose."
"no matter how you rationalize it haha"
"its just sketchy "
Yeah
"i usually get the pills that come straight out of blister packs with proper packaging and everything"
"this is just in its most potent form."
"you know its a real pharmaceutical though right?"
"those are so bad for you"
lol
"don't even tell me that"
yeah
ah
"Oh gosh"
"hopefully this will be the last amount of sketchy canadian drugs i have to order. theyll be here in like 3 days.  i hope my ativan can last until then"
"im not, already asked my parents for their info"
"don't back off on it though"
ok
"okay i called and they need both my insurance holders dates of births and ssn's. so ive gotta wait on that now"
"They work in collaboration with highland hospital. They're owned by the same. Many of the doctors do out patient there. They're very good.  I don't know everything about them but I'm certain that they would have psychologists on staff"
"Okay do they have a both types of doctors too?"
"I still stand by them"
"Try process strategies if you want "
"3047686170 psycare.   "
"They said their psychiatrist isn't taking new adult patients and gave my the number to psycare?"
"because thats when my lunch is"
"i hope theyre open passed 4"
"found a phone number atleast"
"huh ill try to look it up"
"not sure"
"yay okay ill call today, do you know what time they close?"
": - ]"
"and anticipate good results"
"just make the appointment asap"
haha
"that works great"
"a bunch of stuff "
"what does he have you on currently?"
yep
"do you still see him?"
"no problem"
"this could really turn my outlook around"
"thanks so much for your help"
"yea true, they would ask"
"because thats true"
"they;; askk you all this"
"yeah thts fine"
"how about if i just mention that im on ativan .5 and it doesnt really work"
lol
"which they also know how to spot"
"or risk looking like a med seeker"
"you have to trust that people know what they're doing"
"they will"
"i need benzos and therapy, not one without the other"
"what if they just dont give me anything then?"
"those things are pretty experimental and bad as faras i know too"
haha
"don't act like you want meds or know what meds you need either"
"yea i know"
"You should probably stop doing that as soon as you get to someone"
"the new benzo i ordered, well its the same benzo, but i cant find it in its pharmacuetical form anymore. now its powder. and the scales i have are lame and dont measure very well."
"yup we'll see"
"well see I suppose"
"not sure hm"
"wonder how long their waiting list is"
"thank you, haha"
" yeah"
"something like that"
yes
"should i maybe just say hey, i have crippling anxiety, my primary care physician said i should look for a psychiatrist but id also like a psychologist because i need to work through it with help"
"lolol i love that guide to an awkward doctors appointment scheduling"
haha
idk
"that is what my problem is or what i am looking for"
"and then you say"
"it's best to let them tell you about what they offer probably"
"so on"
"and thenyll ask you what kind"
"You need to make an appointment"
"that i need a psychiatrist or a psychologist or?"
"do you have their phone number? or i guess ill just call the main office and then what should i say?"
"because i was lost as far as proffesional help"
"but i really, really appreciate the help"
"i wont mention you"
"but yeah"
"I wouldn't mention me though lolol "
"I've been trying to avoid this because of a conflict of interest. but yeah. My psychiatrist recently opened private practice there, and he is the kind of psychiatrist who talks to patients in depth. Very good with brain chemistry. "
"Have you been there?"
"Yea true. I'll call on lunch and see if they're open. "
"do it"
"He would treat you differently as an adult as well"
"Huh well I could try to schedule something there."
"All I know is that I highly recommend you try and get an appt "
"Maybe, maybe not"
"Ohhh okay. So would I have to talk to him? He never helped before. He would just tell me to ignore Mindy."
"because he wasn't authorized to. They didn't have a psychiatrist on staff then"
"I don't like asking for benzos, it makes me feel bad "
"I mean he never gave me anxiety meds then, why would he now?"
So?
"But he already knows me "
"Damous would be a good place to go now."
"Damos probably 6 or 7 years ago. Process strategies when I was like 6 "
"How long ago?"
Damos
"Samoa "
"And I've been there too lol "
Who?
"I've already had.him "
"If that isn't do-able, I'd suggest process strategies next to the sport mart on maccorkle ave."
"Damos psychological servies on D street in south charleston. They have a psychiatrist on staff as well as a psychologist."
"where are good places? i need to find some"
"i dont remember the other places"
"jeanine walker"
"Where have you tried to go?"
"they arent a psychiatrist, just my primary care doctor prescribed it"
"a good psychiatrist would prescribe you something else"
"with what you're dealing with"
"i kknow"
"That's not commonly prescribed for severe anxiety honestly"
"yea but usually like right now im on .5 ativan, i have to take like 6 for it to help"
"if a couple weeks later you don't feel better"
"a good doc will prescribe everything correctly"
"based on the severity of your sitution "
"don't tell them things ""wont work on you"""
but
"you tell them that you did that"
"Here's what will happen"
"theyll put me in drug treatment or something"
No
"you have to move past that just to get to the point of going somewhere"
"that if i tell someone i used to use all kinds of drugs and weak benzos wont work on me"
"im just afraid"
"that would be cool"
"they just have different specializations"
"there are places where two work literally side by side"
"I can recommend places"
"is there not a doctor that can be both?"
"Where have you tried?"
"and they have like 3 month waiting lists"
"a psychologist will give you a good reference to a psychiatrist "
"but all of the psychs here dont accept one of my insurances"
"i have insurance"
"If worse comes to worst you need to apply for a medical card and get to a psych-something"
"blaahhh spelling"
"ive tried to get a psichiatrist"
"very true"
"but THE WORST COULD"
"like maybe nothing will happen"
"yea and expensive, like i told you, i have to supply myself with my own benzos"
"the impending doom of going a day without something"
"for me"
"The dependance is crippling "
"That's why I think you need therapy. not a counselor...a psychologist, a clinical psychologist. They work in conjunction with MD's to utilize meds as well as other techniques"
"they make me able to function"
"i dont get high off of them"
"im no longer afraid"
"because they make me feel normal"
"i am a benzo fiend"
"but the fact is"
"but I refuse to subject myself to that"
"docs think anyone that wants anxiety meds wants to get high, and is a benzo fiend"
haha
"I know I could "
"I bet you could"
"not the millions of tiny problems that it creates"
"because pills only solve the initial problem"
"And a lot of docs will want you to do things like face fears, talk to people, ect"
"it really is life effecting, like i could get disability for it"
"its one of the most serious overlooked diseases"
"Exactly "
"yea it starts out chemical and then your anxiety creates more anxiety"
too*
"but it's also pretty psychosomatic "
"anxiety is chemical to"
"for depression, other things, no that's chemical"
"and I can't rely on them forever. I know they're necessary for a lot of things, but I want to solve my anxiety my SELF "
"for me anymore"
"But pills aren't enough"
"and now it looks more like abruise"
"I experience  those kind of things"
"when i got my benzo refill the tingling stopped"
"like my arm tingling and looking purple, my mind does that"
"but my anxiety CREATES the symptoms of a clot"
"I think that's probably it"
"that sounds really awful"
"like im pretty sure i just have a bruise on my arm"
"Honestly, I'm just really open to trying this thing I'm researching. I feel like if I can find a physical balance/peace I won't worry so much about my physical mechanics, and the worry won't be there"
"its crippling"
"Oh god"
"im always wanting to go to the ER"
"yea i do still get that paranoia. i forgot about it honestly because my newer fear is much worse. my fear recently has been more of a bodily harm fear. like im terrified of getting a stroke or blood clot.  "
"PANIC blah"
"What do I do with my hands? my wallet? my legs? my eyes?"
"purchasing a meal at a fast food restaurant "
"such as...."
"Am I behaving a lot different than they are in the same situation?"
"and think"
"you look at other people"
"and like"
Yeah
"the last 3 i ask myself all the time"
"Getting from point a to point b without paranoia "
"It's not appearance with me....it's like....


am I walking funny?
am I staring at someone?
am I slouching?
How to I stand and be comfortable?
"
"it used to be worse for me honestly, chris has helped me out a lot as far as being self conscious about my body.  i dont even think about what i look like anymore.  but sometimes it creeps back up on me."
"just from anxiety i suppose"
"I can't even walk correctly sometimes"
"that's my whole life"
EXACTLY
"thats really cool, and yea i feel like my entire physical being is kind of embarrassing just from my movements and stuff"
idk
haha
"Just like, standing in line, and what to do with my hands and stuff"
"The violin teacher from ohio state came here and talked a bit about it, because apparently like late in life she adopted it and doesn't even get jittery anymore when playing for large audiences. So much of my anxiety comes from paranoia about my posture and discomfort such as when I'm walking in public. The techniques apply to everything, but there are specifics to different tasks, just like tai chi I guess. Feeling comfortable with myself seems like a solution"
"whered you hear about it?"
"huh, ill have to look that up"
"Kind of  seems like it would eliminate anxiety "
"There's this thing called ""The Alexander Technique."" It isn't yoga, but it helps you find comfort in every physical motion your body goes through. Kind of like tai chi I guess? It's supposed to help you find a physical balance, just  comfort in everything you do. So no activity will cause you pain, and because pain and fear of pain in any kind causes mental stress it cuts that down a lot. I think you have to take classes but there are a lot of books on it"
what?
"but i have an order to get my arm x-rayed and i would have to wake up early to do that and i just havent done it"
"You know what I wanna do?"
"i know dude haha. i thiought i had a blood clot in my arm the other day and went to the doctor and they said it probably isnt a clot, probably just a deep bruise"
"even food selection"
"of any kind"
"decisions are the worst thing in the world lol"
"Fine honestly. I just am having personal problems. My main issue is that I suck at saying important things, or forcing myself to say them, or picking which ones to say."
"decisions upset me a lot. how are you and bella?"
"i would guess"
"My grandfather's passing, my contempt for morgantown, a couple of uncomfortably awful personal issues, hard decisions "
"so with your recent upsets and depression, what would you say its all caused by?"
"right now its just people selling hot snakes at reptile shows under the counter, sneaking them in with styrofoam coolers"
"kind of but not really. well, not yet.  when they ban them all there will be."
"is there a black market for reptiles"
Haha
"i owe a lot of people money for animals lol, thats the only way to get ahead in the herp world, is to use payment plans to get shit you could normally never afford"
"150 dollar frogs"
"yea and i dont have them completely paid off yet anyways"
"Im sorry :/"
"I would offer to get them but it's just not possible "
"and i hate driving my poop car"
"im going to have to take off time from work to drive there just for frogs"
"and i have no way of getting them here, he wont ship yet"
"im buying some blue pacman frogs from the guy there"
haha
no
"do  you know of a pet store called scales n tails in motown?"
"after these benzos stop working ill be at that point"
"therapy helps a little"
"I'm depressed beyond the point of psychiatric treatment"
"what is it?"
"it isn't a medicinal  issue"
"I'm on more medications now than your average 70 year old"
"and they dont help?"
Yes.
"do they still have you on benzos?"
"im glad"
good
"got an ativan refill this morning after a freak panic attack, barely got in to see my doctor, so i feel okay now"
"I feel awful"
"I'm just"
"at some point later in the week"
"wanna come over and watch tv and play with lizards???"
yea
"for real?!"
friday
"doo you know when youre coming back?"
heya
"watch Good Hair with Chris Rock"
"if you ever want to watch a movie thatll make you laugh and feel better about yourself at the saame time"
"and they send them to us way before theyre actually due"
"i like that i can just pay them online though"
"havent gotten actual bills yet though, like for water and electric and stuff.  so we'll see how bad those are lol"
"my phone is only 35 a month thankfully"
haha
Woah
"its just so expensive, i already pay 60 a month for internet, thats all im spending on a connection lol"
"netflix is all I need for that kind of thing"
"F tv"
"you know you can watch like everything on the internet for free? we bought a 32' tv and dont even have tv. we just use it for our PC"
"but google is such a great resource"
HAH
"JUST GOOGLE IT"
"yea true, i didnt mean to be ""that guy"" hahah"
honestly
"Just start googlin'"
"i dont know what a good basic degree is"
"i wonder what classes are required for like a basic degree"
"because i would always get overwhelmed at all the different classes i had to do work for"
"You can take as long as you wan basically"
"I think so"
"can you just sign up for a couple of them at a time? "
"I mean you just got through a lot "
"I think online classes would be a good start if you don't want to overwhelm yourself"
Yeah
Hahah
"its like, i go home and try to find something to watch online. but i dont really have anything to DO, ya know? feed geckos, check eggs, press play on Portlandia, repeat. lol"
"but maybe online classes would work"
"i just dont like to over challenge myself"
"yea i guess i do"
lol
"if you feel you need to challenge yourself then you most likely do"
Yeah
"yea id say so lol. but now that its done its not even a challenge because i work full time and chris and i both bring in plenty enough money to take care of ourselves"
"you accomplished probably...the most difficult one"
"Yeah It's good to continuously set higher ones I think "
"i dunno i just feel like for the past 2 years, getting out on my own was my main goal, and now im there, making plenty money to take care of my stuff, and i dont really have a big goal anymore"
haha
"I haven't experienced that yet so "
"i dunno"
"that's something "
yeah
woah
"I've been there on and off for two years"
"i have my own house and it feels very foreign, i dont know what it is really."
"Yeah I know what you mean"
"i need to do something though, recently i dont really have any long-term goals besides my animals and its kind of put me into this wierd mental state, i guess its like a depression"
"huh well thats really cool at least. ill definitely look into it, and see if wvu is on my list of schools that may give me a free ride"
"like no deadlines"
haha
"you can do it whenever "
"I don't think it is"
"i wonder if online college is crippling hard like online high school was lol"
lol
Yeah
"i didnt know that though"
"but i understood"
hahaha
lol
"I worded that poorly"
"colleges cost less if you live in the state where they are located"
like
"what is in state cost?"
haha
"I just got an email from them about this"
because
"I say this"
"and would give you in state cost"
"WVU has online "
"but with more crime"
"yea dude, like, this is why marshall is just not appealing, its just like GW haha"
hahaha
"Oh my god"
"lindsay looks weird as shit now, shes skinny but looks a lot like her mom with the bug eyes and horse mouth. but bob apparently was like madly in love wit her haha"
haha
"I forgot all about all day"
"Oh god"
"saw that coming, right? lolol"
"they were dating i guess? and darian told lindsay he cheated on her and she straight called the cops and filed against him for abuse and he dropped out"
"bob dropped out apparently, because lindsay wilson got a restraining order against him hahaha"
"like cops just strolled in apparently "
haha
Yea!
hahaha
"for real, during class?"
wat
uhhh
like
"What would you even do"
"Someone got arrested (a prof.) during a class there today for child porn possession "
"i know i may get a scholarship if i apply for one, based on my GED scores, and i can go to Marshall for free but i dont really like marshall"
"huh alright, i definitely will. ill let chris know, too. hes wanted to get into some kind of school as well."
"I'm not sure about the specifics"
"read up on it"
"Either way, it seems to be worth it"
"It's such a valuable degree. Hm I mean some people do it all online, and you can do accelerated programs and such in a couple of years that get you through a certification and an MBA. Some people get a 4 year degree then go to business school. Some people do an associates in something and do a business degree. Some people just do a bachelors degree in like management."
"for business"
"what kind of stuff do you even learn and test on?"
"huh. do you know how many years it takes to get one?"
"it's sad, but it's true"
"I read some article on it"
"look into it. People fish through resumes and trash them until they see some kind of business certification "
"chris is actually a really good businessman as well"
"You clearly know how to run a business then you know"
"actually more money, they lay eggs for 8 months out of the year, so i have no idea how many eggs ill have this year"
"Do it."
"really? huh...that would be cool, because im working on having my own business.  the geckos are coming along really well so far. ill make like 800 dollars off their eggs this year, selling them at really low prices"
"You know what's worth a lot? A business degree/certificate. They're everywhere...here, there, ..There's like a million online programs too if you don't have time. It's a guaranteed higher salary for no matter what kind of job you wanna work "
"huh well thats really cool.  i guess you could keep going to school and join an ensemble and make money playing for people.  i just wondered about the money aspect, i guess.  im thinking about going to trade school for something but i have no idea what."
"I'm realistically not good enough to be an orchestral musician at this point. So I'm weighing everything out."
"Well honestly put off work for as long as possible, so probably grad school. Maybe find a TA position somewhere. All in all, I wouldn't mind teaching at the college level, playing in an orchestra, or playing in a smaller ensemble. On the other hand (dream) , I want to double major in economics/finance and see if I can't eventually work my way into a position to revamp classical music personal and how orchestras are budgeted. They keep going bankrupt constantly. "
"so when you graduate, what do you want to do with your degree?"
"huh, i may have to think about seeing someone then. i just have a crazy work schedule and like doing absolutely nothing on my days off lol"
Exactly
"huh, it would be nice to have someone to talk to that isnt a part of me at all. like i can talk to chris but he doesnt see me objectively."
"but now i feel a little more secure"
"and I hated it "
"I let out things that I've never told anyone"
"im still ashamed of a lot of things ive done and still do"
"i just feel like in therapy you need to lay all your cards on the table for it to work, and im not ready to do that"
"if you present yourself intelligently they will treat you as such"
"they have to assume you don't know what your problems are or how to solve them"
"it's not a waste"
"and let them know that you have a good insight on things as well"
"but if you cooperate completely"
"I used to hate them"
"i need some kind of help, i just hate therapists because ive been forced to see them since my parents got divorced"
"but it doesn't last long"
"it's so awful"
"basic communication"
like
"that kind of stuff needs to be done"
but
"it's really child like at times"
"Oh yeah for suure"
"does therapy help you at all?  i always freak out and start crying when im forced to talk about stuff."
"It's a lot of super complicated personal stuff. Combined with everyone in Morgantown being from Jersey, grain alcohol flowing through their veins. lol. and they hired a new violin professor this year who is so so so so hard. I thought I was gonna get Mr. Tan"
"is it reallt that bad? just being away from your family or?"
haha
"It's objectively been going okay. Although, I had to start seeing a therapist because I'm so insanely miserable here."
"i couldnt do it"
"is it like class with mr jessee but real-life hard? lolol"
"hows school been going?"
yess

"i mean it sickens me sometimes what my mind throws at me"
"I know... I know"
"yea i try but like certain times, such as this week, i cant even sleep. like, im terrified of sleeping now because my dreams are so terrible."
"in my expierience "
"Yes. But the less you fixate on those kind of things the less they happen"
"hey um when you get anxious sometimes do you ever get just like random weird pains in different places? like to the point of expecting a blood clot at any second and not even caring anymore"
"yea me neither, except for when im at work and theres nothing better to do. i only have a tape player in my car and no music on my new phone so i just use spotify and youtube for music when i feel so inclined"
"I haven't been listening to music much recently oddly "
"and are you into beck?  chris got me listening to him and the dudes got groove"
"yea dude, my new car is a piece of poop on wheels but its mine, no one else's and that's cool to me"
"and sweet"
"Oh I didn't know that haha awesome"
"chris is training at my pay rate finally, so we both get paid the same, except i work more hours"
"its very odd, i dont have to answer phones anymore but im so glad i dont lol"
"I imagine 100s of weird middle aged white guys wanting tickets and how weird it is to speak with them"
"yea dude, ive almost just stopped listening to music due to my job lol"
"That must be hell"

"haha, okay. i didnt think petsmart sold giant leopards."
"it's supposed to be"
"As in"

"I think it's a leopard gecko, but it's like abnormally large in size  "
"im trying to think of what petsmart sells"
"a lizard, yes?"

hahaha
"or a large something"
"it's called a giant something maybe"

Woah
"havent counted"

"we keep ours in plastic tubs haha"
"they eat fruit powder mixed with water and dont require any special lighting or heat"
"yea theyre the perfect reptile"
lol
"Well that's extremely convenient "
woah
"they incubate at room temperature haha"
"depends on the temps"
"these took maybe 70"
"anywhere from 50-120 days"
"just curious"
"How long is the incubation period?"
"it was a pleasant surprise lol"
well
"o dam"
"they were just there haha"
"i didnt get to watch"
"I can't say I ever have"
"I bet it's interesting to watch something hatch"
"my two cresties hatched today"
"theyre about the only thing i can afford right now because no one wants a mean gecko, and taming them down will be something to occupy my mind while i wait for more eggs"
"huh okay.  ive got a guy who MAY bring them to me but im afraid someone will buy them before i do so im trying to get the guy to let me paypal him money for them until i can get them"
"this sunday"
"do you know when youll be there next?"

"do you even have my number still?"
"well feel better"
"okay, good"
"well im gonna try to keep my hands off the keyboard for awhile and watch a breaking bad, see if that helps"
"yea i suppose so."
"getting patronized might be worth it in the end"
"If you don't mention something to someone about all of this, withholding your fear of being yelled out and everything, it will just get worse"
"One more thing"
"huh that sounds really nice lol"
"Taking lots of pills is more strsssful than anything"
"Yeah, now I'm on a 1mg extended release that I take once in the morning, and my body is never without a rationed amount. I haven't had a panic attack, like a serious one, in probably a year"
"every two hours? fuck"
"wtf thats crazy"
"it was stressful itself"
"remember when I was on like .25 xanax for like a year? I had to take them like every two hours"
"Like what sucks is that symptoms of anxiety and withdrawal from benzodiazepines are pretty much the same, so if you don't take them on a regular schedule it pretty much does nothing because your body wants more relief "
"just ativan from the other day, and birth control"
"just curious"
"What other medications do you take?"
"yup. i get stress from people in my life and even more stress without them. im lost"
"but it's hard when you can't decide what the problem is"
"I try to find solutions to things in place of blaming as best as I can"
"Yeah everyone is really"
"but im taught to blame in the first place"
"yep i blame modern day america and my mom"
"Everything that you said sounds like an untreated anxiety disorder"
"but anywho"
"theyre friends now i think"
"in all seriousness."
"whaaat haha"
"in the song he goes ""TUNECHI, TUNECHI, TUNECHI"""
"It's like a knock off ""tyler the creator"" type video"
"i think it's rather new"
"I heard this lil wayne song..."
hahaha
god
"im mocking the whole time hahaha"
"OKAY YOU A GOON WHATS A GOON TO A GOBLIN"
"oh my god"
"theyre playing lil wayne in my office'"
"not really trembly, just numb"
"are your hands trembly?"
"nope i dont think so"
gripping?
"do you have trouble gipping things?"
"mostly forearms and hands"
both
"is it both or one? your whole arm? is there tingling? "
"my arms are only numb when i have my hands up to my keyboard. what does that mean?"
k
"gonna go potty brb"
"but i can see that my circulation is fine when i press on my fingernails"
"just the numbness and sweating in my arms"
"Are you still like physically sick?"
"Therapist, keepign a journal and reading it later"
"the numbness is coming back, its so scary"
"potato, pototo. "
hahaha
lol
"what you are saying to me"
"I can say to myself"
"I'm better at this than you"
"Yeah I did it for like 2 and was like"
"yep ive done therapy for about 15 years and im so done with that shit"
haha
"but they end up ALL in your business "
"That's why they say therapists are good"
"Yeah that's smart"
"id just like to talk to someone that has no stake in it and wont jump my ass over everything"
"I wish I could do or say something that could be of real assistance. Advice is just speculation in my opinion. But if you try you try "
"ill probably end up living in ordinance park in saint albans because its on the bus line and i cant afford anywhere else right now"
"It kind of does for everyone"
"Unfortunately the real world kicks the shit out of my own standards"
yeah
"I set them for myself. It's not my place to set other people's"
"for fucking ocne"
"i want to set my own standards for once"
"Everyone has standards that they're expected to live by, for whatever reason"
"but i have to go home and live by everyone else's standards and deal with chris' parents and my mom and ill have to pay a shitty landlord, and im fine with that, but i just want to get it over with"
"that's just enjoying normal things."
"Yeah exactly"
"bah humpbuhg"
"SO MUCH TEXTING AND NO COMMUNICATING "
"yea for real.  i just want my geckos to thrive and to work here for the forseable future, not fuck up and enjoy my normal life"
"I'm thinking ""(seriously, you only live once, don't mess it up)"""
"Everyone else is like YOLO"
"Maybe we just look at the world realistically "
YES.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm just an old soul, and that's why I can't make any friends. I grew up way faster than everyone else mentally."
"haha oh yeahh"
"yea haha this is social media, we can do whatever we want"
"Wait can they even do that? Just leave?"
no
"but do I want to make a fool of myself and then brag about it to everyone?"
"and things like that."
"Like, I enjoy the taste of alcohol with food"
"One of my main issues is that I grew out of partying and that's all anyone ages 13-25 wants to do."
"theyre all going to see marilyn manson and im the one who gets to work for them while theyre gone"
Haha
"yea i mean i wasnt invited anyways haha"
"no brainer then right?"
"and my coworkers are going to smoke weed together but if i do ill have to go to the hospital"
"Because they're getting something out of it deep down. They know that in the public eye, they're more attractive. They know that they can outsmart them in conversation. They might be their ""back up"" friend. They might be friends with them just to maintain a certain social status"
"I don't get it"
"but how do people want to go hang out with their besties and chill with their homies and do nothing with them? like, go to starbucks or watch movies or something"
"NO one genuinely has a friend for no reason."
"Everybody does it."
ect
"You have a friend you confide in, one that you bully, one that you wish you were"
"human nature"
"You always want something out of a relationship with someone"
"no one would ever accept it though"
"that's basic."
"that's just how friendships work though"
"and I wish i could find joy in other people"
"I notice that I just don't find joy in hanging out with people that I don't get something out of"
"Yeah it's like, you watch people out with their friends having fun and think ""WHAT AM I DOING DIFFERENTLY"" "
"like, HOW DO I NOT FIND PEOPLE FUN LIKE EVERYONE ELSE"
"I must want something, or I must just be using them"
right?
"Yeah same here. It's so out of this world for me to be genuinely interested in hanging out with someone"
haha
"the truth is I did make a lot of bad friends, and they did suck"
"so I don't mess with that"
"If I do they're like ""Oh look it's michael the ass hole back to tell us how much we suck"""
"and no one ever seems to want to"
"yea and like if i contact old friends they think im just trying to manipulate them"
"to eat"
"just like"
"I just like going places sometimes"
"I don't wanna hang out with the scene kids that I hung out with when I was younger, and anyone else stopped being my friend when I started hanging out with scene kids anyway"
"I don't even know who to contact"
"but theres no one that doesnt blow me off"
"yea, like, sometimes iw want to go hang out with someone. like, go eat somewhere are walk around the mall even."
"but there's a line you know?"
"and I am sometimes, I guess"
"I don't either just because I thought I was happy being an introvert "
roxanne
"no one responds to my texts. not even roxann"
"like, not even one."
"i realized the other day that i literally have no friends"
"I tried patches and e cigs, and things but flat out quitting was the only thing that seemed to work properly. "
"Yeah quitting smoking is so physically and mentally awful"
"you'lll feel a lot better"
"huh didnt know that"
"but if you can get through it okay"
"but the sweaty palms and stuff, that's symptomatic of nicotine withdrawal "
"I didn't either"
"i didnt even think i was addicted"
"When I quit I did it cold turkey and was buggin' out for weeks"
so
"yea i guess o"
"but in the long run, it will get a LOT better due to the lack of smoking"
"That is probably part of your anxiety"
"i quit smoking last week"
"dietary things can really mess with your head."
"I'm trying to just cleanse my system"
Yeah
"I have an addictive personality, so if I go a day without coffee it's like I'm quitting smoking"
"i like it but if its bad fuck it"
"but it makes anxeity worse "
"I'm a BIG coffee drinker"
yeah
"i just drank some coffee so thats probably a player"
hm
Agh
"Omega 3 supplements help too. Matt has taken them for years and years. Also, caffeine is bad. I've learned that recently."
"but i cant leave until 9:30"
"i need to go somewhere and sleep i think"
"I try to fix myself. Just mentally talking myself down, and doing square breathing "
"my heart rate does seem elevated. i have a D deficiency i believe."
"a lot of what medication doesn't fix"
"It could always be the good old fashion ""vitamin deficiency"" "
well
erg
HM
"make sure you're moving around a lot. That sounds weird, but because so much of anxiety attacks deals with blood pressure and heart rate, muscle movement can help. Just keeping a steady blood flow to all of your extremities "
"i have good circulation, i had it checked"
yea?
Honestly
"what should i do about the numbness?"
"thats crazy, i have a high resting heart rate too"
"The numbness is a serious thing though"
"It doesn't always work, but hey "
"I just try and surroudn myself with people who do not stress me."
"My grandpa has this heart rate monitor, and I put it on my finger to test something out. I have a super fast Heart rate anyway, but when anyone would speak, or even move or stand up at all it would jump to at least 110 and I would start sweating profusely "
"i just want the sweats to go away and my hands to stop being numb"
"I just don't have them"
"That's how I am still"
"because like im having conversations with coworkers and i still feel like im on the verge of an attack'"
Basically
Yep.
"when youd have attacks, would it be like...like you dont even think you're stressed because you're not thinking about anything stressful but it happens anyways"

"They just work for me, and I asked my doc about it personally"

"Med seeking patients tend to get prescribed XR anyway because they want a quick rush"
"junkies do like the quick rush lol"
"huh okay."
"If you ask about extended release tablets that won't raise any flags. That's not junkie talk. That's informed patient talk."
"which i kind of understand but christ, she has to see the phyical evidence of my illness"
" See, I'm not psychiatrist, but...I think Extended release tablets work wonders. Taking pills ""as needed"" throughout the day just makes it twice as difficult. I used to be on .5's of a lot of stuff. It hardly lasted like an hour"
"i need something but im afraid to ask because my mom will call me a drug addict or something"
have
"no theyve just put me on the ativan .5 and mom only let me has 1 a day"

"Have you ever been on Extended Release anything?"
"yea like my arms are tingly now and my palms are sweating"
"and my fingers and toes"
"My head used to get tingly "

"It was a blood pressure problem"
"i thought i was having a stroke or something"
"it scared me so bad ihad to leave work wednesday"
"I did pass out"
"did you feel like you were going to pass out?"
"My limbs used to go numb and stuff"
"that sounds more like panic disorder type stuff or super severe anxiety. Deff not generalized anxiety dis. "
"and i honestly dont know whats really the problem with me besides anxiety, my limbs go numb and i get cold sweats"
"but sometimes they totally are"
"I wish medications weren't necessary "
"I understand"
"i just want to find an apartment, move in, and work every day, and be okay"
"and i hate talking to these junkie dope slingers"
"been trying to find real benzos for days and no one has any, meanwhile im almost crying all day at work"
"ativan does nothing for me either haha"
"and no not from the flu, still going numb from anxiety"
"got prescribed to ativan .5 which literally does nothing for me"

"i think martin mcquade got me hired"
"It sounds like it HA!"
"how so?"
"its like a reward for being cool haha'"
"i feel like i got hired into a purely politics position"
"yea but theres so little work to be done, its ridiculous"

"I gotta go 2 bed y0"
"So now that I've hit that low and built that foundation, I can build upward"
"means something for sure"
"That is actually a really nice realization "
"Now I know that I can live with Chris in a tiny room and eat poor food and do nothing but be around each other every day and be happy"
"it seems like an expiereience"
Yeah
"I don't regret going there though."
"It was. And is."
"Macaroni is delicious  "
"I ate ramen every day. And macaroni "
"Lol! wow"
"Hardly had gas to get gas. Lol."
"Didn't eat out at a restaurant one time."
"I don't know what to make of that"
"We did have internet. So we spent a whole.month watching movies and playing video games in our closet sized room."
wow
"Water was free.in the trailer park"
"we lived in a trailer. Chris's stepdad Tim got disability. Just enough for rent. And food stamps."
"Like how were you living down there?"
"He didn't start working again until like a month and a half ago"
"A month in, I was crying every day and Chris offered to move back and try to get his job back."
"I want to leave this state, but I don't know or think I'm quite ready yet"
"She expected Chris to just find a job."
.___.
"And the tiny town of king is so overpopulated with Mexicans that there isn't one job opening in like a thirty mile radius"
"what did she expect to happen?"
"fuck her"
"What a piece of shit"
"We had everything planned. It was supposed to work. We were going to save money and move back here. But his mom lied. She didn't have a job when we got there. We had zero money except for food stamps and Money my dad wired me for basic stuff like shampoo"
ya
"The NC trip?"
"Did you expect that to work? or did you want it to really badly?"
"It was all me. He just supported my decisions because he loves me."
"And I was the one that wanted to try living in NC so badly"
"I mean I can understand why. It looks like he stole me from my childhood. But he didn't. I made him let me stay with him."
"I don't know what it is"
"and I can't describe it"
"I have an odd feeling towards him"
"I don't know"
"I just"
"I don't dislike him"
"I know you don't like him, and that's okay, I get it, but I think he's good for me."
Grand.
"That's a very good thing."
"And me for that matter. I throw fits sometimes. But he never gets overly upset. He always talks me down "
"And he handles my mother like a saint"
"I'm so much happier now. I'm so grateful for Chris. maybe he did contribute to my rebellion a few months ago. But he also got me off hard drugs and doing stupid shit"
"the gate of hell"
"cross lanes was like"
"I'm so glad I was able to let go of him and the cross lanes life "
"Shayn really messed with mybhead"
"Oh gosh, really though"
"I'm sure you understand that, being a Libra, our romantic relationships effect our whole outlook"
"not in the good way"
"He isn't human"
"and shayn is "
"I'm glad you're you again"
"I couldn't get the love I wanted from shayn so I just wanted to feel good any way I could. "
"I don't doubt it. I was a mess."
"I wanted to cry"
"You did heroine or something"
"I just remember being in the office and being searched"
"Dude I honestly don't even remember that"
"It really came to a head the one time we went off campus with aaron and mitchell and came back to school"
"I didn't really want to be known as a junkie. It just happened."
"Yeah I caight that"
See
"Yea like when I did it I genuinely didn't want people to ser"
lol
"You wouldn't look at everyone and smile before you snorted something if you were addicted to it"
"He'll learn eventually.  We all do."
"Yeah my thoughts exactly "
"He's fine without drugs. He doesn't crave them. "
"Yea I know. But he's not an addict. He's doing it for attention "
"Mitchell is still doing the same shit...snorting shit off of the table behind backpacks"
"You know what's sad"
"I mean I was happy. But it wasn't good happy.  It was scary happy. Like a roller coaster drop with no leveling out"
"I made nudges at the fact that I didn't like certain things"
"I hinted all the time though"
"and you seemed happy"
Exactly
"Because of course you didn't want to offend or anger me because you're my friend "
"I wouldn't have known what to do either "
"I didn't have it in me to talk to you seriously"
"But ill blame my addict genes "
"over it"
"I was sad a lot."
"I could blame shayn. Lol."
"Yea I mean I just wanted to defend myself, as anyone does. But I'm not stupid. Once I had my mind cleared I could see what my life had.become."
"slapping you in the face with accusations was never the way"
"I feel like you needed the alone time to contemplate this"
"It was an odd time for sure"
"I'm glad that now I have money instead of being retardedly high all the time and looking like a dead person "
"It wrecked me."
"Yea looking back now I'm ashamed of my former self"
"It was scary"
"blinded, I guess is a better word."
"but you didn't understand that it escalated "
"It wasn't so much a big deal at first"
"I'm glad you realize this now"
"Chris says if I ever do it, he's leaving me."
"I'm so glad I kicked opana. Like, even thinking about my time with shayn is like teasing myself because of the physical effects of that drug. Its something I have to take extremely seriously. I know if I never had quit, my life would be ruined "
lolol
"Speaking of drugs"
"Yea fuck that shit "
"Which scare me"
"Its like triple c's"
"some people are fine"
"Some people trip for weeks then go into psychosis forever."
"The results vary so much"
"Different brands have different effects but most are either Meth or ecstasy basically "
awful
God
"Yea dude. Chris tried it once just for product testing. It's Meth."
"reallhy lmfao"
"I know so much more about bath salts than I ever thought possible"
Hahaha
"BATH METH"
"It's called"
"I guess ill just have to lose weight like a normal person. If only there was a pill for self control."
"And sad."
"but it's true"
"That's a sad truth."
"I guess ill go in and have him try something else on me. Atleast for Chris's benefit. Because if I don't enjoy it I know It makes him insecure "
"Haha that sucks "
"Risperidone (yet again) is the worst thing ever. I just wanted to eat and lie down. ALL DAY"
"Almost completely"
"It takes away my appetite "
"for me at least"
"Usually depression meds do the oppisite"
"So I don't know what to do"
"But it prevents me from enjoying sex"
"So celexa is making me lose weight"
"Wtf ftw wft ftw "
Hahaha
BACKWARDS
"It's what you said"
Snup?
"wtf snup"
"Puns ftw!"
Hahahaha
LOLOLOL
OMG
"Yea. A baby. Lololol"
"I'm waiting for the day. I thought about doing away with her, but then realized that it's immature to think that stuff. One day she'll get whats coming."
"She should be hit."
"Makes us look like garbage people."
Wooow.
"Is a witch to him."
"my sister publicly makes fun of Matt.  "
"I just want to get out. But its so hard to manage"
"The worst thing is"
Yep
WOW
REALLY
"Except those videos that I don't quite get."
"Chris would always ask why I have to clean everything in the house and Lee sits on his ass and eats candy"
"He doesn't do shit."
Yep.
"you don't go to school, but you intend to graduate in your own way. It's the same credential. He and my sister do what they want, and don't even get a stern talking to"
"see what pisses me off..."
-___-
"He skips class every day and gets virtually no punishment "
"and really?"
"I feel like she's going to get pregnant and run away"
"My brother is also failing"
"I WISH I COULD"
"She isn't even really giving a shit about credit recovery. Not that I should give a shit, but my mom does, it drives her mad."
"She failed every class except art."
"You should kill her in her sleep."
"She failed out of school?"
"She allegedly is moving in with my dad at the end of this year"
"She's failed school, won't accept punishments, does what she wants, dresses like a SLUT, is talking to different guys all the time, lies, steals, schemes and turns family members against each other, really attempts to cut deep into peoples emotions, has an awful reputation which is embarrassing to me, she won't get help either. I think she has a personality disorder. It's completely out of hand"
"What did she do?"
"I bet she's intolerable "
"literally ruined any chance of us being a family"
"but she has ruined my family"
"I know that sounds crazy"
"One of my main issues is my sister."
Idk
Well
also
"I get so frustrated with life. I feel like there's no progress. "
Exactly
"But its an inside force. Chemicals"
"I just feel like I do not even exist. I kind of feel like a machine, going through tasks."
"It feels like an outside force makes me feel ways that don't make sensr"
"I'm glad someone gets this"
"Me too."
"The scar is still there"
"I just want to feel normal"
"I remember that"
"and bruised it really badly on a wall"
"earlier this year I cut my hand up really bad on a clock"
"I've had an issue with that"
"I haven't cried in so long."
"I get so angry. I punched a wall and bruised my knuckles recently.  Like over and over again."
"I can't maintain at all. I cry constantly "
"I try to play it off. I don't cry, I don't panic anymore. I don't even know if I have panic attacks anymore. I maintain composure, but I have perception issues."
"I started to cry and I had to hide in the bathroom "
"I had to have mom pick me up from the library right after she dropped me off Wednesday "
"I had to leave school today. I just felt trapped and kind of wanted to run, lol"
"I get tunnel vision a lot"
"Yeah I get that"
"And I have to lay down or I pass out"
"Hahaha I think I have bad bodily issues because I get light headed and my ears ring and I start sweating g all over"
"buuut, I have these out of body experiences which might be caused by tiny seizures SUPPOSEDLY. I haven't had a VERY IMPORTANT MRI yet "
"And you never will. Thanks, lamictal."
Hahaha
"I don't have seizures "
"but it ALSO stablizes moods"
"it's actually a pill for siezures"
well
"Does it maintain the mood you have when you take it? Or just maintain a general happiness all the time?"
"Lamictal? "
lawl
"I have everything."
"Concerta for ADHD. Lexapro was not bad for depression at all, it was just risperidone. Lamictal is really good for stabilizing my moods"
"Have you tried any meds that didn't effect you negatively? "
"Haha me too"
"I hate feeling flat. I have a flat personality anyway."
"I got out of risperidone on that. I just looked up some adverse side effects and claimed they affected me. The pill wasn't helping me in any way anyway."
"Zoloft shouldn't effect much. Its generally okay. Just makes you feel flat"
"But I don't know how to be like ""it makes sex bad. I need something else'"
"I just took zoloft for the first time today."
"I took lexapro and risperidone for a while, and that not only completely removed sex drive, but motivation in general."
"So I may need something else"
"Zoloft didn't effect that"
Yeah
"But its interfering with my sex life. And that's depressing "
"I'm on zoloft now, because I'm depressed again."
"And its okay"
"So I'm on celexa now"
Lolol
"Let me retrieve our catalog of substrates "
"""What substrate would you recommend for this here scaly chap?"""
"I was going to make that comment a second ago."
"I say it in petsmart to sound knowledgeable "
"I like the word substrate."
"Sand. "
Sand.
"The word is starting to grind my gears,"
"that sounds awful"
"So I have to buy course sand."
awh
"He can't use hitlers play sand that I have 250 pounds of because its too fine and will get in his nostrils "
"He actually needs a special substrate "
Hahaha

"i hope you like"
"And then emerge, complete."
"So he can dwell.beneath it for many moons"
"I need to buy sand for my snake."
Hahaha
"ITS HAD TIME TO SETTLE"
"OH GOD THE RESIDUALS "
"Can't risk it"
"Yep. And someone smoked weed in the room a couple days ago so ill get a contact high "
Hahaha
"There is dog poop residue everywhere > I have e coli. "
lol
Residue
"She gets upset because there's ""smoke residue"" on the walls in Chris's room and it's bad for my lungs"
"She still treats me like a small child"
"And insane "
"She's just a control freak"
Why?
"And thats interesting."
"And I'm only allowed to spend one night a week at Gary's "
"answered that itself"
oh
"How's that been going lately? about the same or worse?"
"She wont let Chris here anymore because of something so trivial its not even worth explaining "
"I mean mom makes everything worse on me"
lol
"it would reduce stress no?"
"That would be really cool"
"And we've been saving so much money"
"I'm trying to move out soon. Chris is getting a car like super soon and then he gets a raise to 11 dollars an hour "
"Still have a lot of conflict"
"Eh it's the same"
"Hows about you?"
"stressful. I had a had a crazy weird reaction to an antibiotic I took today, so I feel kind of dead."

"That's matt, that's matt."
"Haha he stared for awhile and then half waved nervously "
"But my mom told me she saw you"

"Your not allowed to see me anyway. Your mom hates me a whole lot. "
"Nope, no crying.  We don't ever see eeach other anyways.  If anything, we'll spend more time together once I move than we have in the last three years."
"I'm going to cry all night ."
"I'm sorry.  I really am.  But I can drive in on the weekends and see you."
"My heart just broke "

"Listen, I've been medicated for severe anxiety and I have manic moods and crippling depressions.  I fucking hate everyone at my school.  I am moving at the end of my junior year to Shepardstown and taking all of my classes online next year."
